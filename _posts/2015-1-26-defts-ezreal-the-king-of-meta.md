In the ever shifting Meta, it is hard to stay relevant for long, but few champions such as Ezreal have managed this feat. Ezreal is an extremely versatile ADC and is consistently picked throughout the entire of the competitive history. His popularity has fluctuated but in the recent pre-season, he has seen resurgence in terms of his play. The reason why Ezreal has been able to be so potent is due to his versatility. TPA Bebe had innovated Ezreal by creating blue buff Ezreal, which has both burst and DPS. The trademark feature of Ezreal is also highlighted in this build, as BB Ezreal is almost impossible to catch and is a slippery target for any assassin or bruiser. 

In this article, I am to improve your understanding on Ezreal as a champion by offering you in-depth analysis, give you an insight on how the pro player Deft plays Ezreal and hopefully give you a good read on the way!

## Why is Ezreal always viable?

Ezreal is so potent in all Metas because:

• He is the arguably the safest ADC. His flash-like blink is available to him every 11 seconds, not counting the fact that he reaches 40% CDR with the blue build and that the cooldown reduces by 1 second every time a Q hits a target. This allows him to effectively flash approximately every 6 seconds. The ability to reposition with a blink which cannot be disrupted is huge in terms of his kiting. When the enemy has a dive team, Ezreal will always be a viable pick due to the fact that he can stay alive.

• He is extremely versatile and can built the Tri-Force build or Blue build and even AP if you’re trolling or if you’re Siv HD. This allows professional players to make smart in game decisions and optimize for certain situations. For example, when in a kite heavy team composition Blue build is preferred but when upfront damage is wanted; opt for a Tri-Force.

• Has both burst and steady DPS. This is really important as Ezreal can devastate enemy squishies with his spell rotation or kite and apply steady sheen procs with his Q. This means that he can be played many ways and he is useful in both aspects. 

• He is a flex pick as he can be played both AD and Mid. I simply cannot stress enough how important flex picks are to pro teams. It gives them so much room to maneuver and play mind games on the enemy during champion select. Believe it or not, a good pick and ban phase can decide the outcome of a game.

• He can play from behind. He is not super item reliant and can hold his own with a few items. When jungler’s camp him or when he is put into a bad matchup, he can safely farm and harass with his long range Q. 

• He is rarely touched in patches due to the fact that he is viable but not dominant. That means that he is seldom changed and you should learn Ezreal as he will always be viable to play with in your back pocket.

## Who is Deft?

Kim Hyuk-kyu (김혁규) better known better known by his gamer tag Deft was previously the ADC of Samsung Blue, and regarded as one of the best ADC’s in Korea, Deft has joined the Great Korean Migration to China where he now plays for Edward Gaming. Deft replaces the legendary Chinese ADC Namei who shares a safe and consistent playstyle with Deft. Some speculate that it Namei’s replacement was due to his disappointing run in The World Championships. He is actually extremely well known for his skill shot based ADCs and especially his Ezreal play. Deft utilized his Ezreal against Vici Gaming in the first game and he earns the score of 6/3/11 and wins the game. He also earns the MVP for the game due to his impressive play.

## EDG VS VG

### PICK AND BANS

Deft picks Ezreal after seeing Sivir and Thresh picked by the bot lane of VG. Many think that Sivir counters Ezreal due to her ability to block his spells. The important factor if they were to duel is the fact that if a Mystic Shot is blocked, not only does it deny a large portion of Ezreal’s damage; it also prevents him from gaining attack speed from his passive, which causes him to be weaker. However, after seeing the Thresh and Jarvan IV pick Ezreal is still a good option. The ability to dodge hooks and waltz out of the cataclysm makes Ezreal a safe pick against that dive heavy comp.

### Early Game

Both teams rotate to top and they end up with a 2v2 fight. Thresh is warding mid and this leads to a situation where Annie is able to zone of Sivir, which allows Ezreal to have a free farm lane. Due to this, they gain the level two advantages and pressure the VG bot lane up to the tower. After this, Deft continues to poke at Sivir every time he comes up to farm and last hit. After landing to two consecutive max ranged Qs, Ezreal gets first blood at 3:49. He has the level advantage and is ahead by 19 CS (1 kill worth of gold) by the 6 minute mark. 

![Early Game Deft's Ezreal](/images/content/deft-ezreal-early-edg-vs-vg.png)

They then rotate bot lane and tells Rumble to go top. This brings the match back to the normal set up. You may be asking, why would they want to go bot after dominating the enemy duo? The answer is simple, due to the preseason changes, Dragon is worth a lot more and by having the duo bot lane, they can easily set up dragon takes. Even if the enemy bot lane rotate, they will continue to win lane and Rumble is the better dragon fighter and Irelia has already used her teleport.

Rek’sai camps in the bottom side of the map, knowing that if they get a kill, VP have no chance of contesting dragon. When MaTa wards the Tri-Bush, he is collapsed upon by Rek’sai. Combined with Ezreal’s bursty spell rotation, they delete him instantly. They instantly rotate to dragon after this kill and they easily secure it without any resistance. Despite the fact that Rek’sai did not have smite.

### Mid Game

Deft opts for a blue build this game. At this point Ezreal is really strong and has a commanding 30 CS lead on Sivir. The game breaks into a stalemate with not much teamfighting or organized skirmishes. The enemy Syndra is as strong as Ezreal and they work to get picks around the map. Ezreal and Rek’sai are able to secure a dragon. VG attempt to collapse but the combined mobility ensures that they can easily escape from their clutches. The first and last major teamfight broke out at Red team’s Brambleback and Dragon area as they attempted to contest the 3rd dragon that EDG goes for. Note that at this point, EDG is 3000 gold ahead of VG. 3 dragons give 5% movespeed which is a huge buff and combined with the mobility and chase potential of Ezreal, Rek’sai and Jayce and the lack of thereof on the team of VG, this makes chasing and rotation  a easy job. Irelia and rumble zone out the respective carries. But due to the nature of the location, the area being a choke point, Rumble lands a huge ultimate which not only damages and zones them out, but he is able to stay alive with Zhonyas. The combined damage of the carries of EDG easily shred through the Irelia and the damage taken by Rumble force VG away. This leads to a 2 for nothing exchange in favour of EDG, on top of the dragon.

As both teams dance around the baron area, Syndra finds a pick onto Rumble and bursts him down with  the help of Mata’s Thresh. Deft spots sivir spots Sivir split pushing in the bottom lane and chases in to duel her. In the image below, you can see despite Sivir blocking the Mystic Shot and getting crits onto Ezreal, Deft is simply far too strong and overpowers Vasili.

After a series of 1 sided skirmishes, EDG secure Baron Nashor at 25 minutes. In these skirmishes, Ezreal has blue buff which is almost a necesity for him. It caps his CDR at 40% and allows him to poke and constantly keep up his Manamura drain. After this EDG have a unsurmountable 10k gold lead and take the game after wiping out the members of VG in their base. 

## Items

![Deft's Ezreal items](/images/content/defts-ezreal-items.png)
 
Although the game closes out before Deft’s full build is shown, I have found another game where he starts out with the same items. I predict that this is the build that Deft would have followed as it starts out the same. Sometimes, Deft takes Essence Reaver but to be honest, it isn’t really viable in terms of statistics and should not be picked in competitive play. Always remember to get the Fuhror Enchanment on your boots as it helps kiting. It is essencial an useful on almost all ADCS but it is especially powerful on Ezreal as it procs on his Qs and helps in his kiting. It is essentially a replacement for Phage as he opts for the Iceborn Guantlet instead. This allows him to get the best of both worlds and makes him one of the most slippery champions in the game. 

## Ability Order

![Deft's Ezreal Ability Order](/images/content/defts-ezreal-items.png)

Always max Q on AD Ezreal. It is such a strong ability in terms of poke and damage, and although the mana costs increase per rank, the damage increases dramatically and the cooldown decreases by .5 seconds every level. Next up, upgrade is E as it lowers the cooldown and allows for more mobility. W isn’t really that useful as AD Ezreal as it scales on AP. Deft does not take this until level 4 and maxes it last. W grants attack speed to allies and Ezreal if he uses E into the stream. It also grants him attack speed as it can easily hit many enemies and proc his passive. Take a point in Trueshot  Barrage whenever possible. 

## Runes

![Deft's Ezreal runes](/images/content/defts-ezreal-runes.png)

Deft uses a standard AD rune page of AD and armor. However, there is a special emphasis on cooldown reduction. With CDR boots and Iceborn Gauntlet, you can achieve 25% CDR without bluebuff. At level 18 with his masteries, he can have an additional 12% CDR which leaves him at almost the maximum at 38%. If he is lucky enough to have a blue buff he will be capped at 40%. Normally we seen some attack speed runes but Ezreal is a caster ADC which means he relies more on his spells than he does on just auto attacks. Health runes are fairly unusual but they allow him to stay alive in the early to mid-game where Blue Build Ezreal is at its weakest. 
 
## Masteries

There is the standard 21 points into offense. All ADCS should take this as it boosts their damage output by a substantial amount. Usually this is coupled with 9 points into defense but in order to keep spamming his Q in the early stages of the game; Deft takes 2 points in Meditation which helps with his mana sustain and regeneration.
