### A lot of people these days want to go pro in LoL. How did you get into the pro LoL scene?

Oh god - that's a tough question. I remember back in Season 1, I started with my rank 5's team. We were all 1500 elo (that was gold back then) and that's where it all started. We were just playing ranked 5s for fun and during that year we just discovered some people got better and climbed up the ladder. 

At some point Season 2, my friend and I were at 2300 (diamond back then) and we formed a team with all diamond players. We started playing on the ESL. I think the way that we got noticed was just the fact that we played [Go4LoL](http://www.nationalesl.com/us/lol/go4lol/) placed quite highly, picked up new members, picked up better players, and found new friends. Then, we got contacted by organizations who were interested in sponsoring us.

We started with little salaries - *50 euros / month* - and we took it! We eventually started winning Go4LoLs, and got sponsored by [Playing Ducks](http://www.playing-ducks.com/) in April 2013. Next, we played in the [German scene EPS](http://www.esl.eu/de/lol/eps/) and qualified for the challenger series. 

> Basically, the main idea was we had 5 friends, improved improved improved, and competed against really good players.

### When you started playing LoL, did you think going pro was an option?

Nope. The thing is for me, 

> if I play a game, I want to be better than my opponent. I don't like being bested.

I just started playing ranked 5s with friends. We noticed that we can win and at some point, we just started playing tournaments for fun, for money, and for RP. 

> Before you know it, you're already there. I never had the mindset that I only wanted to go pro. I had friends and I enjoyed playing with them. It's really important to enjoy the game or else you won't be able to reach the top. 

You see people at the LCS that just burnout. If you don't enjoy the game, there's no point playing it because it drains you.

### Now that your pro, has that weighed in on your playing style?

It's definitely different when you have to play League of Legends for 6 hours a day or more. I couldn't play more than 5 hours a day because I had to go to college classes. 

> It's not as fun anymore. It's a completely different environment. That's the point when you need a goal.

To stay in the pro scene, I need a goal like winning a certain tournament to be able to practice 5 hours a day. 

* How long do you practice every day individually and with your team?

Well, right now, it's kind of difficult. The ESL pro team is building up and we're finalizing the roster right now. 

> When we were playing the challenger series, we tried to play every day of the week as much as possible, usually 4-5 hours / day. 

When a teammate needed to leave early, we might practice in SoloQ. I played less SoloQ but I was always there for the team practice. The practice is needed to stay at a competitive level. 

Every player has different needs though. Some players need to play more and some players need to play less to stay sharp. 

> To hold your own, you need to practice every day.

### What does competitive LoL practice consist of?

Practice is always generally different. 

* We found scrims against other teams. And we basically just tried to win them. 
* When the meta changed, we would try playing new champions. 
* We would practice lane swaps. 
* And try different team comps.

> At this point, my farming needs to be perfect.

When we had a [LoL coach](http://www.gamerunners.gg/), he was spectating our games and pointing out our team mistakes. The coaching helped us strategically with different team comps and team gold management. The coach taught us what map pressure means and was constantly trying to improve our warding so that we could have better vision control.

> The training was very different with the coach, and I liked it in a way. It covered so many aspects. 

If you don't have a coach and you just play as a ranked 5 team, usually you just scrim and try to make a team around your best champs. 

> If you have a coach, he's not afraid to tell teammates that he screwed up. 

Champion select is so important. Some people can't understand it, when you are on the stage and you're doing champ select - can forget some stuff. But, if you have someone standing behind you, he can be more objective. It just really really helps.

> When you are on stage, your mind is on stage and sometimes you can't think clearly. That's why I like the change in the LCS that made it possible to have a coach on stage.

### What is it like when roster changes are made? Are they simply regarded as a necessity?

This is completely different from team to team. I can speak for our team - we've been a team for over a year. We didn't want a roster change but we had to eventually switch out our top-lane. 

> The problem in the LoL pro scene is that if someone underperforms he gets blamed so much, just because he underperformed for 2 weeks. People get replaced so quickly in LoL. I don't like that.

Doing roster changes might be a mistake but it also might be the right thing. Teams that got into the LCS have the mentality that switching players is the right thing. I still think everyone should have the opportunity to fix their issues. 

> That's why you have a coach for, somebody's bad at certain things, just help them improve it! 

I really like [C9](http://cloud9.gg/) as a team - they've been a team for over a year now and they consistently playing well in the LCS. I'm in a big fan of the concept of helping people fixing their problems. It might not be better for the short-term success of a team, but for long-term success, I believe it's better to help teammates improve. 

Sometimes, a roster change brings fresh air - which is important. But, when your friend is gone, it might lower your mood and you might enjoy the game less. In the long run, that's very bad. 

* What are your hopes and dreams as a pro LoL player? 

Should I give the standard now? that I want to be in the LCS and famous. 

The thing is for me, I had the biggest shot quite a while ago with Playing Ducks in the challenger series and I just noticed how much work it is and how little success there is to actually get into the LCS. 

It's just so unlikely for someone individually to get into the LCS. I mean, it's wonderful for the person if it happens to them. 

> There are so many players that are like if I don't get into the LCS, I'll stop playing the game forever. 

I realize how hard it is to get into the LCS, so I want to try to be relevant in the scene and the game but also enjoy it as much as I can in the amateur spot right now. If I go back 5-6 hour trinaing, I know I won't enjoy it as much and I still have to finish college. 

At the moment, I want to be enjoying the game as long as I can while still being relevant. Obviously, I'd be happy if I ever make the step into the LCS and gain popularity - that's always the big dream, why not?

This is not something that I would actively want to chase and be disppointed if I don't achieve it. I think this is the more mature way of thinking about getting into the LCS. You see so many young kinds who are good at the game who put everything on the line to get into the LCS which is unlikely to happen.

> Never ever give up your education, it's always more important than League of Legends. 

It's just a fact. There are some players who got extremeply lucky, they finished school, it worked out for them - it's cool that it happened to them! They say it's really ioportant to finish school and go to college. It's unlikely that you'll have a full time job by being on an eSports team. Always finish your school. Put it before LoL.

Also, the parents are always right (I know you didn't want to hear that).

## Till Werdermann - Manager of PlanetKey Dynamics eSports

### Your 18 years old, how did you become the manager of PlanetKey Dynamics eSports?

When I was 13, I started my first gaming clan and had a few years of eSports community management under my belt before joining PlanetKey. I first joined PlanetKey as an editor, and quickly became the managing director of PlanetKey eSports.

### Are you considering college or are you in college right now? 

I finished school pretty much half a year ago and now I'm working at PlanetKey Dynamics as an eSports director full-time. I'm considering studying something in marketing but I haven't found something that really interests me in the moment. I really enjoy it.

### Where do you see your career going is it more towards managing these eSports organizations or do you want to own a team or manage large events?

I like certain parts of the esports culture - managing events is one of them. We're starting our own tournament series right now with an invitation tournament for Heroes of the Storm. And we're working with some pretty cool partners there so I really like that perspective of organizing tournaments. I also really like marketing, not only in eSports, but just gaming in general.

### Right, nowadays a lot of companies are looking to get into eSports. And, they don't have anything to do in particular to do with eSports but it's the company way of owning an NFL team where they can basically generate ads. Much like how Samsung has Samsung White and winning the LCS was a ton of impressions for all the people watching. You are starting to see a trend where companies are looking to pick up pro players and pro teams as a way of promoting their company and your interested in facilitating that activity?

Yeah, that's pretty much what I want to do because there's a lot of potential. I'm really looking forward to the time when all companies are looking to eSports for marketing opportunities. PlanetKey decided to go into eSports because they thought it was a really interesting marketing opportunity. It started off with a small budget and suprisingly became much bigger. From an outside perspective, you really don't see what goes on to make these events happen. It's so much work but it's also so much fun.
