After he announced he was coming out of semi-retirement and moving to North America to compete in the <b>LCS Expansion</b>, many people expect a lot from Korean legend Yoon <b>"MakNooN"</b> Ha-woon. Known for his <i>incredibly aggressive play and tower-diving tendencies</i>, <b>MakNooN</b> has been a crowd favorite for many years thanks to his tenures on both <b>NaJin Sword</b> and <b>CJ Entus Frost</b>.

Since coming to NA, <b>MakNooN</b> has immediately shaken up the meta, picking unusual top-lane champions like the new <b>Sion</b> and reviving his hyper-aggressive play-style which had previously earned him quite the following.

All this is to say that when <b>MakNooN</b> picked Poppy in the NA Expansion Tournament, I wasn't surprised: what else could I expect from the tower diving master himself? Poppy fits his play-style to a tee with her high damage and assassination potential.

So today, we'll take a look at <b>MakNooN's Poppy</b>, and what he did to take one of the League's least played (and most often forgotten) champions to the big leagues.

Before we jump into the games, however, I want to go over what makes Poppy a legitimate pick in competitive LoL and why you shouldn’t dismiss her as a troll pick in your own ranked experiences.
   
## The Power of Poppy:

<u>The Secret Passive:</u> Quite possibly the most underappreciated aspect of Poppy is her passive, most likely since it reads so weird: 

![MakNooN's Top-Lane Poppy](/images/content/maknoon_poppy_passives.png)

But when fully understood, Poppy's passive must be recognized as one of the best in the game since it gives her a level of deceptive tankiness that goes far beyond her items. The key word in her passive is "current" - basically, her passive scales effectively no matter what HP she might be at.

Only the PORTION of damage that exceeds 10% of her current health is halved. For example, let's say Poppy is at 200 HP and takes 80 damage. That's 20 (10% of her current health) plus 60 (the amount that exceeds it). The 60 is halved to 30, so she takes 20 + 30 = 50 damage. While this passive might seem that strong at first, it makes Poppy <i>EXTREMELY</i> difficult to burst down and gives her a level of survivability which can be completely unexpected. You’ll often last a little bit longer in fights than anticipated, giving you the crucial seconds you need to land one last Devastating Blow.

For a perfect example of just how effective Poppy’s passive can be, watch this video: 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EWrFSUqb1Ks" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Her passive is vital in fulfilling Poppy’s role as a truly melee assassin – once your ultimate wears off and you find yourself in the middle of their whole team, you’ll be surprised at just how well you can take a beating thanks to <b>Valiant Fighter</b>.

<u>The Unstoppable Assassin:</u> Anyone who’s played against a fed Poppy knows the pain of Diplomatic Immunity. The ability to ignore all CC and damage from all sources but your target is a tremendous advantage, and shockingly versatile as well. 

That being said, it also makes her one of the best disruptors and assassins in the game – while many people might not consider Poppy as an assassin, it’s certainly how she should be played, taking advantage of her unstoppable ability to dive onto a single target and obliterate them.

Don’t let her small stature fool you. 

> Poppy is one THE BEST late-game assassins in League if given the opportunity to shine.

Especially in a pick composition or a skirmish lineup, Poppy’s speed, damage and relentless diving potential can bring something to the table which is utterly unique. In the right hands, Poppy is a lethal weapon.

<u>She Has Problems, But...:</u> One of the main issues which Poppy must face is a tremendously weak early game. On their own, her skills are not very powerful – items make Poppy into what she is. Without gold, experience and time, Poppy is very, very vulnerable for the early stages of the game. Much like <a href="news.gamerunners.gg/lol/loopers-kassadin/">top-lane Kassadin</a>, Poppy has a relatively long period of “infancy” where she must be sheltered from ganks and fed farm as much as possible. 

In this regard, it is rarely advisable to pick Poppy into a bully laner such as Ryze or Gnar. A non-interactive laner or one with low kill pressure is a much more favorable situation for Poppy, such as Nasus, Mundo and even Maokai. Choosing the correct matchup is critical for getting Poppy to her first major power spike and beyond.

That being said, Poppy is a late-game terror, and if the match goes late you have the potential to take over the game. Like with all good things, patience is required. 

So despite her early weaknesses, Poppy brings a lot to the table in terms of surprise factor, a powerful ultimate, incredible assassination potential and one of the best passives in the game.

But how do we bring her into a game? It’s time to dive into <b>Team Fusion versus Enemy eSports Game One</b> and learn from one of the best.

## Team Fusion vs. Enemy Esports: The Game and the Goal

I had one purpose in mind for picking this game in particular to analyse, and I want you to keep something in mind when watching this game: <i>never give up and making yourself useful even in the worst of situations</i>.

With that being said, here is the game:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ixI7M0H7EdI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

So, is MakNooN’s play in this game flawless? 

<b><i>Hell no!</i></b>

But what it is is a master class in one thing: <b>staying relevant</b>. If there is one lesson I can impart in this article, it is how <b>MakNooN</b> kept himself in this game on a champion traditionally considered to be useless if shut down early (and he certainly was so). Understanding what you can do on Poppy (and any champion really) when you start the game is a critical part of improving at <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/">League of Legends</a>.

On the other side of the equation, I also want to discuss how <b>Fusion</b> reacts to <b>MakNooN’s</b> early struggles, and what they do as a team to keep him in it – because knowing how to play with someone who is behind is just as important as known how to play from behind yourself. 

With these two goals in mind, let’s jump in.

## Staying Relevant: MakNooN’s Side of the Story

Giving up first blood on a Poppy is never what you want to do – and giving up a death immediately after Teleporting is even worse. But sadly both of these things are the way MakNooN starts out this game. Left in a dangerous 2v1 situation at the start of the match, <b>Enemy</b> immediately takes advantage of Poppy’s early weakness and complete lack of waveclear, diving <b>MakNooN</b> under the tier one tower for a quick first blood. 

![MakNooN's Top-Lane Poppy](/images/content/maknoon_poppy_diving_1.png)

Not even Level 3 four minutes into the game and without a creep kill to his name, <b>MakNooN</b> nevertheless does his best to contribute, linking up with <b>NintendudeX</b> and <b>ChunkyFresh</b> in an aggressive gank onto <b>Otter</b> and <b>BodyDrop</b> – even with his early death, <b>MakNooN</b> knows that his<b> Heroic Charge</b> is the extra little bit of crowd control needed to close out some kills, and as such shows no hesitation for diving into two people. Picking up <b>Inori</b> and <b>Otter</b> in the dive, <b>Fusion</b> nevertheless overstays their welcome which forces <b>MakNooN</b> once again to back away from his precious farm. 

The consequences of the dive are immediately apparent – without his Ghost, <b>MakNooN</b> once again finds himself the target of a dive under his tower which leads to a second death within three minutes of each other. Enemy clearly recognized that a Poppy shut down early is a weak Poppy, and do their best to punish <b>MakNooN</b> for his errors, no matter how minor. 

After such a bad start, <b>MakNooN’s</b> first thought is to get himself and open lane in which to recover. Notice how quickly finds himself a home back in the top lane once <b>Nien</b> leaves to go group with the rest of <b>Fusion</b>. Taking advantage of the time alone, <b>MakNooN</b> quickly double his farm numbers and picks up the all-critical level six. 

Another important thing to note is how immediately aggressive <b>MakNooN</b> is as soon as he picks up his ultimate – he looks to make sure of it right away and press his advantage, no matter how small it is. Moving towards <b>Enemy’s</b> blue buff, he swiftly finds himself surrounded but thanks to the power of <b>Diplomatic Immunity</b> is still able to trade one for one in a 1v3 scenario. 

![MakNooN's Top-Lane Poppy](/images/content/maknoon_poppy_one_for_one.png)

### Why is this the correct play? 

* Whenever <b>Diplomatic Immunity</b> is off cooldown, use it. The amount of raw power it gives is too good to pass up, and <b>MakNooN</b> knows this – even in a desperate situation he is still able to pick up a kill.

* When behind, even trading one for one can be worth it: it gives <b>MakNooN</b> a burst of much needed experience and takes the opposing jungler off the map, letting his team breathe a bit easier for a few moments. 

* The relative worth of a shut down top-laner and an 0/1/3 jungler are very different – even with his death, the amount of gold and experience <b>Enemy</b> gains is paltry compared to what <b>MakNooN</b> aquires.

* He still has TP off cooldown, meaning he can quickly get back to lane without missing a creep after his death.

Now I’m not saying that diving recklessly into three is always the correct play; merely that in this situation trading himself for a kill is definitely worth it. Leveraging Poppy’s incredibly strong level six is critical to recovering in a game, and therefore making use of his ultimate as soon as possible was the correct play.

It is at this point that the high level of focus that <b>Enemy</b> put onto <b>MakNooN</b> turns out to be a liability – <b>Cackgod</b>, despite being 1/0/1, is still only level 5 while <b>MakNooN</b> is well on his way to level 7. <b>Cackgod’s</b> only kill participation were in multi-man attacks onto <b>MakNooN</b>, so his experience gain from the kills was extremely minimal. Looking across the map, <b>Nien</b> managed to carve out a significant gold and experience lead thanks to the completely free lane he enjoyed for the majority of the early game (but more on that to come).

Heading into the mid-game, <b>MakNooN’s</b> scoreline does not look good on paper – at a miserable 1/5/2, you might think that he was struggling greatly. And yet, the opposite is true. Despite his score <b>MakNooN</b> is still ahead of <b>Cackgod</b> in terms of both gold and experience. Soaking up so much pressure from <b>Enemy</b> in the early game gave the rest of <b>Fusion</b> the ability to completely take over the map, and once <b>Enemy</b> realized their error, it was too late. 

Throughout the mid-game, <b>MakNooN</b> always seems to find an open lane to push or a neutral camp to clear as his team pushes their advantage across the map. And thanks to the experience disadvantage that is the result of <b>Enemy’s</b> relentless multi-man ganks onto <b>MakNooN</b>, they need to send all five members to deal with <b>Fusion’s</b> four, father freeing <b>MakNooN</b> to farm up. 

![MakNooN's Top-Lane Poppy](/images/content/maknoon_poppy_diving_2.png)

Look at the change in <b>MakNooN’s</b> play once he hits his first major item spike – <b>Trinity Force</b>. Although throughout the game he often grouped with his team for objective pushes and Dragon fights (and more often than not was the sacrificial lamb), the Tri-Force signals a shift in <b>MakNooN’s</b> priorities due to the fact that the item is such a significant step up in terms of his damage and survivability.

From then on, <b>MakNooN</b> is rarely far from his team – they now need his damage and assassination potential to close out fights onto the damage dealers of <b>Enemy</b>, who have a significant front line advantage in <b>BodyDrop’s</b> Braum and <b>Cackgod’s </b>Maokai. 

<b>MakNooN</b> is now strong enough to do his job properly: kill the squishies. And the fight at 23 minutes perfectly demonstrates not only Poppy’s potential but also how to play her in a teamfight. Look at how <b>MakNooN</b> runs right past <b>CackGod</b> and <b>BodyDrop</b> thanks to his ultimate and goes straight for <b>Wolfe</b> – he doesn’t care about his team following up, only about doing his job of eliminating a single target. 

And although he drops immediately after, he draws enough focus and cooldowns for <b>Fusion</b> to reengage onto the weakened <b>Enemy</b> team and clean up the fight. 

![MakNooN's Top-Lane Poppy](/images/content/maknoon_poppy_quad.png)

Even though <b>MakNooN</b> struggled in the early game and is still not in an ideal position early on in the mid game, he recognizes that if he trades his life for Wolfe or Otter, it is more than worth it. He never allows his poor position in the game to become a liability, but instead throws himself onto the fire for the sake of his team. 

Eventually, <b>MakNooN</b> and Fusion’s hard work and patience pays off as he is able to pick up the damage slack and obliterate the back line in fight after fight. <b>MakNooN</b> never let his poor start impede his mission or change his mentality. 

Yes, he died a lot. 

Yes, he didn’t farm a lot.

But he made it work by sticking to his guns and making himself useful even in death. That is what it takes to recover from a poor start: do what you can until you can do what you must.

I suggest you watch this game again to truly appreciate how deliberate <b>MakNooN</b> is in all his movements. While it might seem at first watch to be a random, overaggressive play style, I guarantee each and every decision he made was for the good of the team and to get himself back into the game when all seemed lost.

## Helping Hand: The Rest of Fusion

![MakNooN's Top-Lane Poppy](/images/content/maknoon_poppy_3.png)

I won’t make this section too long since I wanted to focus on <b>MakNooN</b> as much as possible: but I do think it is important to recognise the excellent work <b>Fusion</b> do as a team to compensate for <b>MakNooN’s</b> rough early start. So, I’m going to point out some of the key details of what <b>Fusion</b> does to get their Poppy back in the game – 

* <u>Nientonsoh’s Journey:</u> <b>Fusion</b> makes perfect use of <b>Nien’s</b> massive gold and experience advantage by rotating him down to bot-lane and fighting at Dragon as soon as he hits 6. <b>Otter</b> and <b>BodyDrop</b> have nowhere near enough power to fight <b>Fusion</b> with <b>Nien</b> on their side, and they are able to secure a quick Dragon. Throughout the rest of the early and mid-game, <b>Nien</b> uses his advantage to the fullest, shoving wave after wave to turret which pins <b>Enemy’s</b> duo lane under their tower.

* <u>Global Gold:</u> Whenever <b>MakNooN</b> is ganked to dies, <b>Fusion</b> makes something of it, either pushing down a tower, taking Dragon or finding pickoffs in the jungle. This is critical to playing in a situation with a player who is struggling – if you see their jungler ganking top for the tenth time, group up bot and fight or take a Dragon. Global gold is vital in getting the struggling player back on their feet and pushing numbers advantages across the map from where your weakest link is relieves the pressure and allows that player to recover in the long run.

* <u>Into the Fold:</u> Once <b>MakNooN</b> is strong enough to fight, <b>Fusion</b> understand that he is still not at the point where he can split-push effectively. He might have recovered, but he was nowhere near strong enough to split-push well and survive while doing so. <b>Fusion</b> adapts to this weakness and instead takes aggressive fights where <b>MakNooN</b> can use his ultimate effectively, picking valuable assists to further catapult him back into the game.

These are just a few tips to keep in mind when playing with someone who is struggling in the early game. There is a lot more to learn from this game and others like it – watch and learn.

## By the Numbers

![MakNooN's Top-Lane Poppy](/images/content/maknoon_poppy_4.png)

### Skill Build:

![MakNooN's Top-Lane Poppy](/images/content/maknoon_poppy_abs.png)

*Source: [Probuilds.net](http://probuilds.net)*

As her main damage source, <b>Devastating Blow (Q)</b> should be maxed first. While its damage does not increase significantly with skill points (but with items), the cooldown is halved at max level and the mana cost does not increase, making it an extremely efficient skill to have maxed by level 9. <b>Heroic Charge (E)</b>, is a skill which I like to call a "One Point Wonder" - that is to say, one point is often enough for the majority of the game. Despite the fact that the damage goes up significantly with levels, the STUN duration does not, meaning that one point early provides you with all the utility need for the early levels. Max it last. Poppy's W, <b>Paragon of Demacia</b>, should be taken at level one and maxed second - the massive increase to armor, attack damage and most importantly, movement speed, are all to good to pass up at a very affordable 90 mana. And of course her Ultimate, <b>Diplomatic Immunity</b>, should be taken at 6, 11, and 16 and used whenever it is off cooldown. 

### Items:

Much like Jax, Poppy is a champion that only requires a few offensive items before she can dish out lethal amounts of damage since her abilities scale so aggressively into the late game with items. Devastating Blow has both a 100% AD ratio AND a 60% AP ratio, making <b>Trinity Force</b> the obvious go to - it increases her burst significantly and the Phage speed combined with <b>Paragon of Demacia</b> makes Poppy very quick. A solid second item is <b>Blade of the Ruined King</b> - once again it increases her burst while also giving her the sustain needed to split-push or teamfight effectively. 

After those two core items, Poppy is free to go for just about any defensive item which is required. It all depends on the game, but <b>Frozen Heart</b>, <b>Randuins Omen</b>, <b>Banshees Veil</b>, <b>Spirit Visage</b> and <b>Sunfire Cape</b> are all legitimate options. For boots I'd recommend <b>Mercury Treads</b> - the tenacity does wonders on Poppy to help you get to your target, but <b>Ninja Tabi</b>, <b>Ionian Boots of Lucidity</b> or <b>Sorcerers Shoes</b> are all viable on Poppy.

Since Poppy's main job is to assassinate one target with her high damage and protection from her ultimate, customize to that target. Is their mid-laner ahead? A bit of early MR can really pay off. Is their AD carry fed? Randuins might be the choice. While people might not consider her an assassin, it is Poppy's forte - and like any good assassin awareness and adaptability is key to building Poppy.

As for full offence Poppy - I would ONLY recommend additional offensive items if you are MASSIVELY ahead and are fully able to 100-0 a single target. In that case, an early <b>Brutalizer</b> might be enough to supplement your damage into the late-game. Otherwise, <b>Yhomu's Ghostblade</b>, <b>Infinity Edge</b>, <b>Frozen Mallet</b>, <b>Hextech Gunblade</b> and <b>Last Whisper</b> are all options.

### Runes:

For runes, Poppy has a wide variety of legitimate options since her builds are so diverse. Since she is so ability dependant for the bulk of her damage, speed and protection, Cooldown Reduction is a possibility. Ability Power or Attack Damage both also work since Poppy scales well off both and the early stats can give you a boost in your laning power. 

On the other end of the spectrum, Health, Armor, Magic Resistance either flat (for early game) or scaling (for an even more powerful mid and late game) are all viable options.

Like with items, I’d say your rune setup should change game to game – are you up against an aggressive lineup? Perhaps a bit more early health and defensive statistics might be better. Think you’ll have the time to farm up? Scaling attack damage and cooldown reduction will make your first power spike that much more potent.

Either way, a good base rune page could look something like this:

![MakNooN's Top-Lane Poppy](/images/content/maknoon_poppy_runes.png)

This page gives a nice balance of early defensive stats with a nice bit of Attack Damage for early trades.

### Masteries:

![MakNooN's Top-Lane Poppy](/images/content/maknoon_poppy_masteries.png)

If <b>MakNooN’s</b> play is anything to go on, who needs defense? As an assassin, a 21-9-0 Masteries setup is perfectly viable on Poppy.

Executioner and Dangerous Game are must haves, while Blade Weaving also ups Poppy's burst. The armor and magic penetration from Devastating Strikes is also crucial since there is very little penetration is a STANDARD Poppy build with Tri-Force and BotRK.

In Defense, Block and Unyielding are great for laning while Veteran Scars and Juggernaut gives you that little bit of extra health needed to survive Poppy’s weak early laning without falling too far behind.

Overall, this is a fairly standard physical damage carry/assassin mastery setup and should serve you well in most top-lane Poppy games.

## Lessons Learned

<u>Knowing Your Job:</u> Even when he got waaaaay behind, <b>MakNooN</b> still recognized he had a job to do. While he may not have been able to pull it off right away, the mere threat of Poppy’s ultimate can shape a fight around it. Make yourself felt even if you fall behind, and do your job as best as you can without compromising your team. Once you feel strong enough, execute your task. 

<u>Pick Your Target and Eliminate:</u> Poppy’s ultimate gives her unparalleled dive potential – identify who on the enemy team is ahead and make it your mission to disrupt them as much as possible. Even when behind, soaking up a carry’s cooldowns and attention is often enough to win your team the fight and if you manage to kill your target, that’s even better.

<u>Playing Around Weaknesses:</u> Like I said, part of the lesson here is not only how to <i>play</i> Poppy, but also how to <i>play with</i> Poppy. Understanding the mentality of the Poppy player and tailoring your play around it can help them get back into the game if they are behind, and assisting them with global gold or pressure on the other side of the map can make or break a comeback attempt. That being said, also understand that once Poppy gets ahead, you can make plays off her aggressive potential. Use the hammer to your advantage, and don’t roll your eyes when the Iron Ambassador gets locked in – she may yet surprise you.
