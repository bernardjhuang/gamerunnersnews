Had trouble last season carrying against impossible odds? Looking for a new style or philosophy to carry the uncarryable? If so, when it comes to turning the mathematical odds upside down, High Damage Champs might be just what you're looking for.

## What LoLKing Says

Let's begin with checking the statistics on LoLKing. For those who aren't familiar with LoLKing, LoLKing is a website that tracks the ELO Rating of Leauge of Legends players. It also has a bunch of other statistical goodies making it a must-bookmark webpage for reference. 

What we're interested in is the highest ranked players, and what Champions they main. Take a look at the current ranking:

Some familiar names here and there. But do you notice a pattern? The majority of the Champions listed here are Damage-Type Champions. So, we come to a question: Is LoLKing saying Damage-Type roles carry harder than other roles? I believe the answer is yes, and this is what this article will be dissecting. 

## Damage Controls Gold Distribution

This might be obvious, but the team that wins is usually the team that has the highest gold. And guess what? If we have more damage, we can farm faster to have more gold. However, when people hear the term farming, they think of CSing (killing minions). But when I say farming faster, I don't just meaning CSing faster. I mean that we are farming faster because we are killing more! Take a look at the scoreboard after any game. The person who has the highest kills is most likely the person with the Highest Damage. 

So if the team that controls the most gold is usually the team that wins, then doesn't this mean that High Damage Champions (who will control the majority of the gold distribution) have the most control of who wins? This brings me to my next point - Damage controls the win/kill conditions.

## Damage Controls Win/Kill Conditions

Ever heard of, "The best defense is a good offense?" Well, this is particularly true in League of Legends (and not the other way around!). 

Damage in League of Legends controls the kill condition. The kill condition is to bring the enemy foes to 0 Health, of which then the enemy dies. Obviously, the only way to do this is by damaging the enemy X amount of times. But think of this in terms of Defensive stats. Is the kill condition secured if we have a Y amount of Health or Armor? The answer is no. This means that the Damage-Type Champions, whom control the kill conditions, controls the stakes of each fight. 

Another way of thinkg about this is burst damage. Take for example, Joe is playing Le Blanc. Joe builds tons of damage. Joe can then blow up the enemy in 1 combo without even getting hit.  Even if Joe did not instantly 1-Shot the enemy, if Joe can bring the enemy to about 20% Health, he forces the enemy to run. If the enemy is running, their not attacking. Therefore, even though Joe did not build any Defense, he has an seemingly high amount of Defense through Offense.

Damage also controls win conditions.

Win conditions includes killing towers, killing inhibitors, and of course, killing the Nexus (essentially backdooring). To win the game, we must take the Nexus,but obviously, this can only be achieved through damage. Say for example, after a team fight, the only person surviving is a Sona Support. Is it likely a Sona Support can end the game? Probably not. But if it was a Vayne, that is a different story! (ADC technically carries harder than AP Carry primarily because of win condition control). It's the same reason why people build damage-only in Maplestory, or why a 2/1 Monster (offensive monster) in Magic the Gathering is worth far more than a 1/2 Monster (defensive monster) more. 

## Damage Breaks all Mathematical Odds (Through Skill that Kills)

How do we win 1 vs 5? Obviosly, we can't be Olaf screaming, "Leeroy Jenkins," charging in 1 vs 5. There's a better way! Kenshin, the wandering ronin samurai, has some word of wisdom for us:

Any Vayne God who has experience 1 vs 5ing will tell you the same as Kenshin, "Kite enemy to death, kill them 1 by 1." But essentially, we just need to break up the fights. Instead of a single 1 vs 5 fight, we'll have five 1 vs 1 fights. From there, we have to kill the enemy before reinforcement can arrive. This requires a lot of damage. If we have enough, we can kill the enemy one by one. Here's a video of a Nocturne doing just that:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Gden-KAckGI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Nocturne would have been slaughtered in a single 1 vs 5 fight. However, because he was able to fight many small fights and win each of them, he won the entire fight. This wouldn't have been a possible feat if Nocturne was a tank.

## High Risk, High Reward

![Why Play Damage - Risk / Reward](/images/content/damage-risk-reward.jpg)

In economics, the higher our risks, the higher our rewards. Conversely, if we take low risks, we won't be rewarded as much. In League of Legends, if we are playing too passively, we do not have as big of an impact on the game. Therefore, playing passively, we probably cannot carry a team where every lane (except yours) is feeding hard. Obviosuly, to carry in these ELO Hell Scenarios, we have to take initation and make risky plays. And to do this, we need a Damager because Damagers control the kill and win conditions.

We can also think about this if we are playing a tank. If we play a tank, we have to rely on our AD Carry to secure the kill and win conditions. But what if our AD Carry is just a person filling (someone who doesn't main X role) and gets assassinated every fight? Obviously, we can't secure our kill/win conditions as well as a tank. This means a tanks success is only limited to his/her teams competence. To increase our win-rate and carry power, we can then try to build some damage to carry, but then we'd be a Bruiser. However, a Bruiser is essentially a Damager with less risks. This means they have less control of win conditions, kill conditions, and gold distribution of the game in comparison to a full damager. Therefore, we derive at full damagers to optimize our control of the game. There's  a reason why AD Carry and AP Carry has the word, "Carry," in it! 

## Samsung White's Aggressive Play

Samsung White, the winner of the 2014 League of Legends Worlds Tournament, are known for their aggressive plays. 
Mata, Samsung White's support, is known for placing the most aggressive wards seen in LCS and his aggressive Thresh hooks set-up kills. This is particularly important in risky plays. If we play passively, we rely on the enemy to initiate or to make a mistake. But what if the enemy never makes a mistake or if the enemy initiates when your teammate is picking his/her nose? This is why making aggressive plays to set-up kills are important and why Mata's hooks are awesome.

Dandy, Samsung White's jungler, is known for his aggressive counter jungling via smite-stealing. He also plays primarily high damage Champions, such as Rengar, to clear the jungle quickly. Dandy also has a high rate of gank success as high damage means he does not have to completely rely on the laner to do all the damage. The art of denying enemies of their farm with counter jungling and ganking is optimized through high damage to speed through the jungle. Eventually, his aggression will pay off with not only complete domination of the jungle, but complete domination of all lanes as well. This makes Dandy the most feared jungler today.

Imp, Samsung White's ADC, is known for his Twitch plays. He initiates fights as if he does not fear death, and scores among one of the highest Damage Dealt to Champion Per Minute:

The highest score goes to Samsung Blue's ADC, Deft, whom locodoco praises as, ""... the best AD Carry in the world, by far." It goes to show that being a high-risk player comes with its award of being one of the best.

## Summary

Carrying games can be tough, especially when every lane is losing. In such games, many begin to build defense. And while building defense is good for playing passively and camping towers, it relies on the enemy to initiate and make a mistake. These mistakes are, however, not in our control! Additionally, whether our Damager teammate can secure kill or win conditions is not within our control. Therefore, playing passively and tanky Champions can only get us so far. On the other hand, If we want complete control of the game, we should try High Damaging Champions. The power to have complete control of gold distribution, kill conditions, and win conditions will be in your hands.
