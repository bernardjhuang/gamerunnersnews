The last time I ran my fingers on the keyboard and punched some Dota 2 info, I prepared you a [cool list with five YouTube channels](/dota/the-5-coolest-youtube-channels-for-dota2-analysis-and-pro-content/). These are a fine starting point to get immersed in the pro scene, watch terrific pro plays and get that inspiration to raise your MMR a bit.

But as you surely know, Dota 2 isn't a serious-only territory. No matter the frustration it can bring out (a friend of mine once almost broke his knuckles after a 65 minute game we lost), it's still a MOBA with its funny moments and ridiculous situations. 

And that's exactly what the five YouTube channels I'll mention focus on: fails, lack of coordination or outright what-the-fuck-were-you-thinking moments. Some of these are actually artists (Wronchi Animation) while others are pure comedy gold (Pyrion Flax). All of them are no less than utterly hilarious.

### #1 [Pyrion Flax](https://www.youtube.com/user/tedhimself)

Pyrion Flax is the British comedy voice of Dota 2 for me. Recently, he has had quite the responsible tasks, including being a caster during one tournament or another, or streaming on Twitch to raise funds for a charity.

However, his YouTube channel is a marvelous combination of humorous, cynical rants, Dota 2 ridiculous moments and other gaming stuff. The main reason I'm adding him here are the ["Pyrion Flax's Guides to Dota 2"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1FcZWF2Bstqelx_7SkiaJEjkvS8hGZDL). If I were to describe them, these are several minute long rants in which the brit explains what a certain hero's spells do in a...uh, well, you have to hear it to get it. Flax also draws all pictures he uses in his “guides” and most of them are pretty hilarious. Enter an example team from his Jakiro (Twin Head Dragon) guide:

I really can't put my finger on which of his guides is the most entertaining. All I know is that he shares my hate for established douchebag carries like Phantom Lancer, Faceless Void and Anti-Mage. Yeah, I guess you're not very fond of these either, especially if you have been forced to play a support due to people instapicking them. But I guarantee that you and I would never have the rhetoric to present our frustration in the way Pyrion Flax does.

### #2 [NigmaNoName](https://www.youtube.com/user/nigmanoname)

Nigma's content isn't much as he uploads new videos monthly instead of weekly (hey, real life and its preoccupations!). The upside to this is that whenever you see there's an addition to his channel, well, chances are it will make you spit out your lungs from laughter.

His highlight content and maybe one of the best series I've seen in terms of Dota 2 comedy is ["Nigma's Shittier Dota Digest"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc7cV_5Ef-czWpm8v_XRtpGE5uUIn93Yd). Perfect editing, lots of ridiculous moments, team miscalculations and his trademark – usage of Attack on Titan and Kill la Kill opening songs as a soundtrack in intense moments.

I remember when he uploaded a video showcasing what Aghanim + Refresher orb Razor could do with [his ultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSGTXkS1CxQ). The number of people in pubs who tried that was too damn high...and their success rate was too damn low.

### #3 [Wronchi Animation](https://www.youtube.com/user/WronchiAnimation)

Wandering around funny Dota 2 channels, you will encounter a lot of people who have a) cool editing skills and b) good humor. However, few are to be marked as artists. Wronchi is one of these magnificent dudes who not only upload funny content, but create what we can unanimously call art.

His core work is ["The Dota 2 Reporter" series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPGUpAWFZPgpT9zbCLZYwhX8I9DLOzuON) which is now into its third season. The series is an amalgam of storytelling, mockumentary and lots of gameplay-related jokes. Wronchi develops each of his characters in a creative way, sticking to a certain stereotype according to the Dota 2 lore.

His voice improvisation (sans the Season 3 Crystal Maiden) are top notch and will have you bursting into laughter. There is even a coherent storyline between the seasons (each season is actually one Dota 2 match with its corresponding Radiant and Dire teams). Once you get introduced to Wronchi's Enigma and Rubick characters, you'll want moar, moar and never-ending-moar.

### #4 [DotaFX](https://www.youtube.com/user/DotaFX)

I know DotaFX isn't limited to the humorous side of Dota 2, as he has created many terrific item sets for various heroes (Invoker and Juggernaut are my favorites). He also has some great insight videos into the pro scene with his “Know Thy Pro” series and did an amazing TI3 coverage with his highlight videos. However, the reason I'm mentioning his channel here is his ["Dota 2 True Stories" playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgqxP-AQTfYYhdZyODsb06zJwa8IKxlqu).

These are outstandingly edited videos with a very cool soundtrack and heaps of unexpected moments and fun stuff. DotaFX has a signature phrase used throughout the series. Whenever a hero is on the brink of death and then somehow manages to stay alive, wiping the other team...well, I'll leave it to you to find out what happens then.

In any case, DotaFX produces high quality entertaining videos which have a little bit of a storytelling in them and flashbacks to previous episodes. You'll binge watch the whole “True Stories” series, I guarantee it.

### #5 [Dota Watafak](https://www.youtube.com/user/DarduinMyMenlon)

DotaWatafak is my most recent finding in terms of funny Dota 2 videos. I guess many people might compare its ["Dota 2 WTF moments"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmqdK5_Qu7DJvgYDsj7kUZFgTsZR6RU4M) to the "Fails of The Week" series coming from DotaCinema. While both of these have to do with people spectacularly failing (oh, pubs, you and your brilliance), DotaWatafak relies more on the editing instead of having a commentary like SunsFan and Reaves do.

One of the key advantages of DotaWatafak is its consistency when it comes to video delivery. “WTF moments” already has 75 videos which speaks volumes since it's been around for an year (+/- 3 months). You can expect to see around two new additions uploaded per week, and while these are usually fairly short (4 minutes), this is 8 minutes of quality fun delivered on a weekly basis.

### Ending thoughts

So once again, there you have it: five channels which will take care of seeing the bright side of Dota 2 whenever you want to pull your hair out and scream at your teammates who have yet again failed terribly. 

That Shadow Demon going the carry with Desolator route? 

That farming Anti-Mage who, 45 minutes in the game, has still not once participated in a fight? 

That enemy Faceless Void who has backtracked 90% of your spells and hits? 

Forget about them and fire up one of the channels I mentioned. You will find great comfort in realizing we've all been there and had our Dota 2 related shitty moments. It's just how it goes, after all.
