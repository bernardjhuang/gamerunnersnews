### It looks like you started your eSports career by being a media manager of HaloSpain, how did you get involved with HaloSpain?

I was a Halo player at first, I enjoyed it's community so I decided to get involved in it. I knew some photoshop and I really wanted to produce content for them so that's how I started. I really enjoyed working with them and help developing the Halo community here in Spain.

### How did you leverage your position of media manager at HaloSpain to become a journalist at GIANTS! Gaming, a league admin at ESL, and the community manager of Wizards eSports club?

I joined GIANTS! with one purpose, to make interviews. I really wanted a 1 on 1 atmosphere where I could ask interesting and controversial questions. I really enjoyed my time there even though it was a short time. 

When I became a league admin I knew some stuff from the Halo days when we use to run some leagues and tournaments on our own, so I used my knowledge to improve the infrastructure they had on ESL. 

And for Wizards, what can I say? It's really easy when you come from a content producing background to develop a fan-base through engagement. Those days really helped me understand what I wanted to become as a person.

### You've done quite a bit of content writing at various publications (SoloBaron, OGSeries, 2k, Artefreak), what has your most successful piece of content been? Why do you think that piece did so well?

I really think that my content for OGSeries was really good. I did analysis on the League of legends meta-game and I even did an in-depth analysis on [Rekkles](http://lol.gamepedia.com/Rekkles) (ex-Fantic player) and his performance at Worlds. As I said, my most successful piece was the Rekkles one since I really got into it. I had stats popping out of the website so you could really see how good (and overrated) he was.

The content that I produced for the other websites was really nice too but I have a warm feeling when it comes to the OGSeries days.

### How did you become the COO of Dimegio?

I was working at an Spanish LAN event called Final Cup 5 as Public Relations, I solved issues with media and VIPs. In the VIP Zone, I met the CEO of Dimegio and we talk about eSports stuff and I made a good impression on him. So after I left the organization I was working with, I reached out to him and I decided I wanted to join the project. As for the project itself it felt appealing at first but then it decayed as the year progressed.

### As the COO of Dimegio, you implemented new coaching strategies and coordinated with the staff team? Were you full time? How was this experience? What was the most important thing you learned while at Dimegio?

Yes, I indeed implemented "new" coaching strategies. They are new for the environment I was working on, we didn't have any infrastructure so I did some research and started building one. We had a coach, a psychologist, a manager and me as the head coach. I ran the organization by myself through 2014 and we really did a good job developing our players even though results weren't great. I was dedicated full time, but I didn't get a cent for my job. That's partially why I left the organization. Regarding the experience, I learned a lot from my "boss", he taught me a lot of eSports stuff and I'm really grateful for that.

> The most important thing I learned is that you can't have a personal relationship with your players. It prevents you from coaching efficiently. Sooner or later you will have to make tough calls and if you are friends with the player, it's way more difficult.

### What would you warn any pro team that they should never do?

Not take any responsibility of your players’ actions or even the decay of his skill. You are the one in charge of them. 

> As a managing director of an eSports team, you are responsible for the pro player's growth, both as a player and a human being, you have to teach him real life skills as well as provide in game knowledge.

You really have to step it up when your player is not at his full potential, when your player is not motivated enough to play, and when the team atmosphere is not great. 

> Don't blame the player’s, blame yourself for not being able to provide them a good training environment. At the end of the day if the team loses, it doesn't matter whose fault it was.

### What made you quit and become the academy coach at GIANTS! Gaming?

I left Dimegio seeking new opportunities, a new environment. When I was the managing director at Dimegio I basically ran it on my own, and I didn't like that. I love coaching, I enjoy doing it and even though this is a "downgrade" I can reach my full potential and demonstrate I can become the best western coach in League of legends. I know that sounds bold but I'm confident enough and I really know I can achieve my goals.

> The Giants trademark suits me, I'm dedicated and as our motto says Excellence is not an act, but a habit.

### Where do you see eSports and LoL going in the next 2 years? What about the next 10 years?

I think that Riot needs to develop amateur leagues, or at least, provide regional leagues with tools to develop their leagues. We need amateur coaches to test themselves and improve in a competitive environment, the League of Legends ladder is not enough. I hope Riot makes an effort and develops a healthy environment where we can practice and get better. 

> I think that in 2 years League is going to grow, not as a videogame but as a sport. As for the next 10 years, I really think that we will be in the Olympics, we are aiming for that and we will eventually get there.

That's why it's called electronic sports, because even though we do no make a physical effort, we train our brains. It's as legit as Chess is.

### What advice would you tell somebody who wants to get into eSports journalism or manage a team?

Write and manage. Make mistakes. If you want to be an eSports journalist, write your stuff, publish it on your own website, seek others advice. And if you want to manage a team, start one of your own and from there, grow.

> Try out new stuff, do your research, never stop learning. That's why I'm here today.

### If you could tell your younger self one piece of advice of how to get started in eSports, what would you say?

Don't make enemies, make friends. Don't make war, make peace. I'm a controversial guy here in the Spanish community. 

**Am I proud of it? No.**

**Do I regret it? No.**

But I really think I could've done things in a different way.

> The more friends you have, the more opportunities.

### What kind of advice do you have to tell aspiring LoL players of how they can get noticed by professional teams like GIANTS! Gaming? 

Focus on your mistakes and what you can control. Don't blame your team-mates, blame yourself for not being able to carry your lane. As Lee Sin says, master yourself, master the enemy. The best way to improve is to win the battle with your inner self. Ego is bad, a player can be replaced but the impact he makes on a team can't. Make yourself valuable for the team, provide to your teammates, not only in the game, but outside of it. Try to build a strong relationship between your teams management and yourself. Don't try to win games instead, focus on learning from them.

### Do you guys scout the ladder and LoLKing / op.gg? Or do you guys scout particular tournaments?
 
We have an academy so we don't scout people; they come to us in order to learn. We have 3 teams right now, the one in the LCS (that's the main team) the Underdogs which compete in the [LVP](http://www.lvp.es/) (amateur Spanish league) and the one we are developing at the academy (info will be released soon). Since we are a Spanish team, at the moment we only look for Spanish players. We take a look at Spanish forums and Spanish leagues in order to have access to the best talent pool. 

And as far as it goes, we have succeeded.
