As a league player, perhaps you already know that, the league of legends generally offers five different roles to a player. And undoubtedly, Support is the least craved and most misunderstood role of all. Unlike the other four roles; raw mechanics and getting fed with lots of items are not really important. Support demands the ability to make instant decisions, keen awareness of map and most of all, very good knowledge of the game. And surely it is a lot harder than just last hitting minions.

While most players apparently have a different thought, Support is no less important than any other roles. Personally, I consider Support as the most important role. It is proven that, having a good Support in team tremendously increases the chance of winning. Along with many other things, map control, big objectives like dragon / baron and the flow of the game greatly depends on the Support, and if Support players know how to do it, they will lead their team to victory without any doubt. Now, if you feel interest in Support and want to give it a try, reading this guide surely will help you with that.

## What’s a Support

If you’re new to the League and want to start with Support, first you must know what it is. To describe, a Support should be able to assist the team, not by nuking everything, but by providing buffs, debuffs and various other aids.

In the early game, they usually go with the carries to help them stay safe, farm and often gets some kills if possible. However, in late game, they need to control the map by warding/dewarding, protect carries from being killed in team fight, or even sacrifice themselves to keep carries alive. Here is a perfect example, representing Support-carry relationship.

Anyway, if you believe, you have what it takes to play Support. Let’s go into the detail, and find out about how to Support your team perfectly.

## Know the Masteries

Starting with masteries, since it is totally free and there aren't many viable mastery pages for Supports.

![Support LoL masteries](/images/content/support-mast-1.jpg)

If you’re new to Support, this page is the best choice for you, especially if you’re playing a range Support like Sona, Janna, Nami or Soraka. On top of that, this page has all the core Support stats like move speed, mana regeneration, gold/sec, and CDR.

However, if you want to play a little more aggressive, there is a slight different page you might like.

![Support LoL masteries aggro](/images/content/support-mast-2.jpg)

The extra 5% cooldown reduction and the “Expose Weakness” ![Support expose weakness](/images/content/support-expose-weakness.png) can be really helpful for an aggressive Support.

But if you’re a lover of season 3 Support page and prefer something tanky! Maybe there is something for you as well.

![Support LoL masteries tanky](/images/content/support-mast-3.jpg)

With this page, you will have basic Support needs, like gold/sec, movement, CDR and bonus exp along with armor, magic resist and bonus health from the defence. To be honest, you can play any Support champ with this page, if you can manage well.

## Rune Pages

Now, as we are familiar with the masteries, it is time to find out the best rune page for you. There are three rune pages I found viable nowadays with the Support role.

![Support LoL runes gold](/images/content/support-runes-gold.jpg)

This one is the classic Support rune page. If you wish to play defensive Support while making a lot of gold without doing any hard work, this one can be the right choice. Ideal for support like Sona, Janna and Nami.

But if you’re more into aggressive Support, there is one you may like.

![Support LoL aggressive runes](/images/content/support-runes-aggressive.jpg)

This page is great for aggressive Support like Zyra, Annie, Lulu, Morgana or even Thresh. But if you’re going to use this page, you will have to play aggressively and make kills to keep up with the gold. Also, this  one is a very expensive page to build.

Although these two are the most used Support pages nowadays, there is a third one.

![Support LoL defensive runes](/images/content/support-runes-def.jpg)

This is clearly a full defense page. If you like to play passively and interested in making super tanky Support, this rune page along with the defensive mastery page, can be a good combination for you while playing champ like Leona, Taric or Braum.

## Summoner Spells

![flash + exhaust LoL support](/images/content/support-spell-1.jpg)

[Flash+Exhaust] to me, it is the best summoner spell combination for a Support.

![flash + heal LoL support](/images/content/support-spell-2.jpg)

[Flash+Heal] You can easily save lives and turn fight with the heal. But it has a big CD and it will be just a burden if you’re planning to snowball and run an aggressive killing lane.

![flash + ignite LoL support](/images/content/support-spell-3.jpg)
 
[Flash+Ignite] good for snowballing and aggressive lane, but it has no defensive use.

## Itemization

As you won't be taking minion kills in the lane, you’re going to need a source of income. And besides rune and mastery pages, only “Items” can help you with that.

![support LoL core items](/images/content/support-core-items.jpg)

There are three core items for a Support. Seeing that, you can only get benefits from one item, you have to choose it wisely. As you can see, Face of the Mountain ![support LoL](/images/content/face-of-the-mountain.gif) is good for tanky Supports, Frost Queen’s Claim ![support LoL frost queen's claim](/images/content/frost-queens-claim.gif) is for Supports with AP damage output, and for utility Supports, Talisman of Ascension ![support LoL talisman of ascension](/images/content/talisman-of-ascension.gif) surely a good choice. So, you need to buy either Ancient Coin ![support Lol ancient coin](/images/content/ancient-coin.gif) or Relic Shield ![support lol relic shield](/images/content/relic-shield.gif) or Spellthief’s Edge ![support lol spell thief's edge](/images/content/spellthiefs-edge.gif) to start with. And considering all of them cost the same, which is 365 gold, along with one of them you can get 2x Health Potion ![support lol health potion](/images/content/health-potion.gif) and a Sight Ward ![support lol sight ward](/images/content/stealth-ward.gif).

However, on your way to finish core items, if you want, you can get the Sightstone ![lol support sightstone](/images/content/sightstone.gif) and eventually Ruby Sightstone ![lol support ruby sightstone](/images/content/ruby-sightstone.gif) as they give both HP and Wards. Anyway, when you’re done with all core and basic items, you can get Locket of the Iron Solari ![support lol iron solari](/images/content/locket-of-the-iron-solari.gif), Mikael’s Crucible ![support lol mikael's crucible](/images/content/mikaels-crucible.gif) or both depends on what the team needs. And above all, if you’re out of choices, just keep in mind that recommended items are not as bad as people say.

## Laning

* If your carry is just farming, let them.

* Don’t ever take CS when your carry is in the lane.

* Always keep an eye on your positioning to  make sure that you’re never in a position to take damage.

* Help carries with some damage when they are trying to push, but of course don’t screw up their farming.

* Don’t go solo on the enemies, even when they are alone.

* Watch and protect your carry like a guardian.

* Don’t play aggressive when you or your carry is low on mana.

* If you're a tanky Support try to force trade damages with the opposing team.

* Engage when your carry does, focus the same target and use exhaust on their carry if you have it.

## Warding

Though it is not only for the Support, but they are most responsible for having control of the map. Without good warding, it is almost impossible to outplay enemies, escaping ganks or stealing dragon and baron.

![Support LoL wards](/images/content/support-warding-2.jpg)

As you can see on the map, for early game, the most important areas are the dragon spawn point and gank routes of junglers.

And for mid to late game, you need to cover red/blue buff monsters, bushes in the jungle along with dragon and baron. There is a map with all possible ward places if you want to check out.

![Support LoL wards 2](/images/content/support-warding-1.jpg)

If you look closely at the picture, you will notice that the best places for sight wards are bushes and gateways. While on the other hand, vision wards are needed on the important and strategic locations like buffs, dragon and braon. However, sight wards and vision wards placement are optional and can be readjusted, if needed. For an example, if the opposing team sets a ward in a known location, you can place a vision ward there and kill it.

## Team Fights

If you can run a successful laning phase, your carry should be fed with decent items. That is the time when you should focus more on global map control and team fight.

Now, to win a team fight, positioning is a big matter. So you have to make sure that you've warded the area including bushes. Because there is nothing more annoying than not being able to attack your target because you can't see it.

When the fight starts, do your thing and get out. If you're an initiator, try to get in, blow your spells and get out of the fight to wait for your cooldowns. Yet, keep an eye on your carries. If you know they will get burst, you should consider going back and take a hit for the team.

Moreover, always remember these, no matter what class you’re playing!

* Never die too much.

* No matter what, never rage at your team.

* Always share your thought on the game.

* Be nice to everyone, especially in solo queue!

* Have fun and enjoy the game.

## Conclusion

After all, for someone who is planning to learn Support, this guide can be an ideal choice to begin with. If you’re new to League, read the guide carefully and try to follow each and every steps. You will be surprised to see your improvement.

Anyway, the main purpose of this guide is to help new Support players, and for now that would be all. However, If we are lucky, there will be detailed guide on specific topics and champions in the future. If you have any questions or opinions, feel free to share them with us. Have a good day Summoner!
