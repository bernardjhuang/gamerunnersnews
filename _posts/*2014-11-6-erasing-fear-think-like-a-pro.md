As every reader of this article is probably aware, League of Legends has an incredibly high skill cap.  And if any doubters exist among you then I refer you to the famous Zed duel in SKT’s match vs. KT in 2013.

These are impressive mechanics for sure, but mechanics alone do not win games; there are two sides that co-exist in Leagues: the physical, and the psychological. You see pro players aren’t just fast, and teamwork alone isn’t enough, individually all great players have something in common…

## They think like a pro.

What does it mean to think like a pro? Obviously different players use different strategies and play in different ways, but there are some traits that are universal, and one of those traits is <u>confidence</u>.

I’d like to impart upon you a quote by a truly great man so that from it we may gather some wisdom.

![Mundo think like a pro](http://statici.behindthevoiceactors.com/behindthevoiceactors/_img/chars/char_113529.jpg)

*“Mundo goes where he pleases” – Dr. Mundo, PHD.*

Pro players aren’t afraid to invade. Pro players aren’t afraid to go into someone else’s lane. When a pro player decides that it’s best to leave top lane and ward the enemy red buff… **they actually do it**. Pro players understand that the enemy team isn’t everywhere at once, they are players just like you; the enemy team is comprised of people, people who don’t have complete vision, people who miss skill shots, and people who make mistakes. And pros take advantage of the openings that are left by the enemy team; there isn’t any hesitation in the mind of the pro, it’s as simple as a click of the mouse.

Look at this graph of player movement over the course of 10,000 games. Look at the video for each lane and contemplate this data for a moment, what does this say to you about the positioning of the enemy players? Reflect on this and when you are finished come back.

![10k lol games in 30 seconds - erase your fear think like a pro](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/09/25/lolstats/3c82cbf17c978b735f2239fe4a634ab81e383ca4/images/poster-main.jpg)

Upon inspection these graphs tell me two important pieces of information.

* 1.  People are afraid to leave their lane.

* 2.  People are afraid to take objectives.

## People are AFRAID.

At almost every stage of the game the lanes are packed by their respective laner; In fact it’s over ten times more likely that the laner will be within walking distance of their farm source. Are you afraid of ganks? You shouldn’t be, because the graphs show that five times more than not the jungler is within walking distance from a buff at ALL stages of the game. Have some confidence! Why are you afraid of the jungler when the jungler should be afraid of YOU?

And not only is the other team’s laner just as afraid of ganks as you used to be, they are just as afraid of getting caught out while taking objectives. How many times has your team hovered around Baron getting up the courage to JUST TAKE IT ALREADY? How many times were you worried that you were going to throw the game away with a bad objective call? The data shows that only a fraction of the games actually had active baron kills, why? Because both teams are locked in a constant battle of “should I or shouldn’t I.” Break the mold. Take Baron 5 minutes after it spawns, grab it when you snag 2 kills mid, and if the other team comes to stop you then take it anyways or kill them. Do it because you can. Do it because the other team is trapped in the game with you.

#### **Mundo goes where he pleases and you can too.**

A word of caution needs to be said, and that’s that confidence isn’t pride. Pride is your enemy. Just because you are capable of making a play doesn’t mean it should be done. At the end of the day your goal is to try and win, not to show off. Another important quality that many pro teams display is… 

## The Musketeer Mentality.

The Musketeer Mentality is that it’s better for five players to go in on a questionable play, than for half the team to go in on an excellent play. Put more simply this mentality is why the shot-caller exists.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kWU6trATodc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Coordination is the key, but that’s obvious isn’t it? Why then do so many teams (even pre-constructed ones) find themselves incapable of synergizing and going in on a single call? Trust is an issue, sure, but if you really look at the issue you’ll find that fear is at the core of this too…the fear of failure. I’m guilty of this as well, in fact in Solo Queue I often doubt the abilities of the players on my team; I find myself narrating aloud why a play will never work. As players we are afraid that if a play isn’t what WE would do then surely it is bound to fail, or at least its likelihood to succeed is much less.

These worries keep us from going in when our teammates make questionable plays, they stop us from taking objectives at opportune times, and they stop us from improving. 
Take a look at this chart of gold distribution across some professional teams.

![gold distribution across pro teams](http://static.ongamers.com/uploads/original/0/2262/7573-gold+distribution+eu+high.png)

Do you think these distributions are random? That circumstance just so happened to make each team function in such a unique way and to place the majority of their team’s gold into whatever lane happens to be present at the time? These strategies are designed well in advance, and they trust one another to be able to use the advantage they give one another to carry each other to victory.

If you are approaching League of Legends like a solo game, instead of reminding yourself that it’s “one for all and all for one” then you’re going to be that guy who loses games, blames his team, and never improves.

You see the last thing that pros overwhelmingly share isn’t in how they handle victory, it’s how they handle defeat. In every game you play of League of Legends you are going to make mistakes, and how you handle those mistakes will shape the player you become.

Your mechanics can always improve, your timing can always improve, your awareness can always improve, and most people accept this willingly. What most people have a hard time accepting is that YOU can improve. Your attitude, your disposition, and your experiences impact the game.

#### **Do not allow yourself to lose the game before you have lost the game.**

And remember at the end of every loss, at the end of every AFK’er, and at the end of every failed promotion series…

## *This too shall pass.*

Your League of Legends career isn’t over. There will always be a next season. And with a positive mind and the help of great communities like these you can learn what you need to in order to improve. You can learn to think like a pro, and you can learn to erase the fear that’s present in all of us as players.
