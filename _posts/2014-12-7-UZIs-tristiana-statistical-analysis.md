Tristana has proved to be a formidable ADC drawing a 50% pick ban rate during the World Championships. The champion was shown at its full potential in the hands of Jian ZiHao, better known as Royal Club’s UZI. During UZI picked Tristana in 3 out of 4 games in the final, Tristana is his most played champion throughout the tournament earning him a 57% winrate despite 3 of the games being against SSW. 

## Ability Order

This is the standard ability order that UZI uses, although in games where he was vastly ahead and aimed to finish the game he will level Rapid Fire at level 7 in order to increase pushing power and DPS in teamfights as SHRC is known to flourish in them and forces these fights as soon as they have an advantage.

Tristana’s E ability has a base damage of 215 at level 4 which made it a powerful harassing tool, and the passive which has a 50 base damage at level 1( increasing by 25 per level) made Tristana efficient at fast-pushing in 2v1 scenario as UZI is often put in 2v1 situations.

## Items

In terms of itemization ADCs have always been said to have limited choices. UZI starts Dorans Blade which is a must for all ADCs. He the buys a single AD item depending on how he is doing lane, usually he buys a pickaxe at the 5-6 minute mark but  long sword and BF are options if he is losing or dominating lane respectively. 

However after this UZI gets <b>Avarice Blade</b>, and then finishes off the <b>Stattik Shiv</b> before building the <b>Infinity Edge</b>, which is the core item on Tristana. It is important to note that <b>Avarice Blade</b> gives him 3 gold per 10 and 2 gold per minion and this allows him to hit the super strong late game Tristana faster. 

## Runes

Uzi runs these runes in the majority of his games.  He takes 3 +4.5% attack speed quints, which in total grant him 14.5% attack speed which with coupled with the pre-nerf Tristana Q gave him 94.5% attack speed without items. He takes flat attack damage and armor which gives him increased trading potential in lane, as he often runs the Janna Tristana lane. He also takes 6 magic resistance glyphs which helps him avoid getting bursted and poke down by the enemy AP during mid game. 

Against an AD lane he takes 4 more attack speed glyphs but when he plays against AP damage orientated bot lanes such as when he is against Corki or a ZIllean lane he takes 9 magic resist glyphs. For any readers picking up Tristana, Uzi’s runes cost 9430.

## Masteries

In terms of masteries, UZI runs the standard 21/9 masteries on Tristana. It is important to note that he either does not take a point in Warlord and Blade Weaving in favor for Dangerous Game.  UZI does this because he plays with a high risk high reward playstyle and Dangerous Game allows UZI to make those clutch plays he has become renowned for. The standard 9 defense allows him to trade efficiently in lane and is what he runs on all champions.
