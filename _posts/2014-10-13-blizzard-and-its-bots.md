Ever since the dawn of gaming, and consequently Blizzard's foundation, back in 1991, a lot of their most-known games have been plagued by different hacks and bots. Games like Starcraft, Warcraft and Diablo have been the target for multiple maphacks and in some cases even bots. Botruns have become something daily within Diablo 3, and to this day are not being dealt with.

## Hearthstone - The last frontier

For a longer than expected by most time, Hearthstone was bot free. The earliest reports of bots were simple AI constructs that used the Warrior class, immediately used their Armor Up! ability to get 2 armor at the beginning of every turn, then would patiently wait until the very last millisecond before ending their turn, thus forcing a lot of people to just concede out of pure rage. This was the beginning of the Doctor Who-esque rise of the bots within Hearthstone. 

## Why?

Currently, there are two main reasons why bots exist. As most players know, for every 3 won games, your account receives a bonus 10 gold. The daily cap for receiving gold this way is 100. So basically, botters are using programs, so that after they finish their daily quests, they can get the remaining gold that they would not normally receive from that daily cap. Having started playing months ago, I do not remember ever reaching that cap myself. 
The other reason is Ranked. As bots are becoming more and more sophisticated, they are being used in Ranked to achieve a higher personal account rank, and in some cases even win the Legendary cardback for the account owner in question. 

## Identifying the robot apocalypse

Currently the most often met type of bot within the game uses the Shaman class. There are a couple of ways to identify them, some more dubious than others, as explained within the Hearthstone reddit:

* Slowness: They take a long time to act, specifically when your side of the board is full. Some of the newer bots have shown better AI structures and act faster.

* They tend to play certain decks - best known for Shaman Giants deck, sometimes seen playing Druid, Zoo Warlock decks and recently Warrior Control decks.

* The time they take between plays is at least for older bot versions at set intervals.

* When an unexpected or misunderstood by the AI play from you is made, they will often start making critical mistakes, which no player at their level would. (Bots can be seen hovering from Rank 15 and above).

* The red arrow typically seen when players using cards is seen hovering over the other class’ hero ability. While there have been theories, that this might also happen for iPad players, I have personally never seen it happen when challenging in-game friends who use an iPad to play Hearthstone.

* They can not play well versus specific decks as the AI structure can not “think through” the possible plays and guess what the other player has in his hand. Known anti-bot decks are Secret Mage, Control Priest, Miracle Rogue and Zoo Warlock.

* The classic bots use either a simple shaman deck, or if possible, Reckful’s Sea deck, as seen below:

## When will it end?

Nobody knows. Currently, if any banning is being done, there has been no word from Blizzard. The closest we have come to any information on the bot problem can be seen from this tweet reply by Ben Brode, a Hearthstone Senior Game Designer, employed by Blizzard:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/FergardHS">@FergardHS</a> we are working on it.</p>&mdash; Ben Brode (@bdbrode) <a href="https://twitter.com/bdbrode/status/520575501606584320">October 10, 2014</a></blockquote>

Cryptic to say the least. In previous games where bots have been a thing, including WoW and Diablo 3, most often botters would be banned after the fact, possibly due to the long queue of data they would need to sift through. This was all done through their own anti-cheat, Warden. The software has been used in games such as Diablo II and III, StarCraft I and II, WarCraft III and World of Warcraft. While the program itself is a part of the Hearthstone game code, according to reddit users, simply put, the anti-cheat has so far been “turned off” as far as they could judge from the coding itself. 

The next question is what happens if Blizzard manages to block bots or at least find a way to quickly identify them and ban them on the spot. One problem might be programs that read from the game, to extrapolate data for websites that host win ratios, deck usage and so on. This would mean that, hopefully beforehand, Blizzard would have to contact the software engineers behind these non-malevolent programs and find a safe way to whitelist them without leaving a backdoor for bot-makers. 

Now, having theoretically done this and found a way to securely identify and block bots, send out bans, whether automatic or not, what comes after bots? Another option for bot-makers would be, instead of having an AI program play, why not just create a program that guides the player, giving him a higher win rate and avoiding some of the more obvious ways that these programs are detected. If properly coded, such a program would only need the game to not be fullscreen, so that it could “read” off the graphics to see what the board is like, what cards you have in your hand and then calculate all of the variables and give you a good play. 

Needless to say, Blizzard is in for another tough decision and a lot of hardships for them and the game’s playerbase.

## Until then?

Until then, sit back, relax, and try not to break your keyboard from another bot-filled day in Ranked. If nothing else, at least we’ll have funny clips like these, to calm ourselves with.
