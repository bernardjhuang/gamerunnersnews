You asked for a better search experience and we've worked hard since launching last Wednesday to bring it to you. You can now easily search for coaches by selecting champions or roles.

## Free / Paid Coaches in Search

Coaches can indicate if their free or paid in their profile now *WHICH MEANS* you'll be able to see it in the search results before considering the coach.

As a LoL coach on GameRunners, the way that you can toggle this in your profile is by visiting the payments tab in your settings. There, you will be able to set an hourly rate!
