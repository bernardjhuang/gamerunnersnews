Welcome to part 2 of The Most Misunderstood Stat in League of Legends. Here, we'll be decoding the enigma that is Armor Penetration.

<p>In part 1, we gave ground to some of the fundamentals of Flat Armor Penetration/Reduction. We saw that this stat is effective against low-Armored target and outlined three keypoints to follow when thinking about making that Armor Penetration purchase. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The first is that Flat Armor Penetration/Reduction is an effective early game stat when everybody has a low amount of Armor. </li>
  <li>The second was that we should target low-Armored target which is the squish in the enemies backline.</li>
  <li>But realizing that we need high mobility to get in range of squish, our third keypoint was that Flat Armor Penetration/Reduction is effective on Assassin-type class champions that have the mobility to jump to the enemies backline where all the low-Armored squishies are. </li>
</ul>
<p>No brainers right? Great! Now we're ready to jump to the more advanced aspects of Armor Penetration.</p>
<h2>The Sweet Spot</h2>
<img src="/images/content/armorreturns1.jpg" alt="Armor Returns in League of Legends" >
<br><br>
<p>This graph shows how much Damage Resistance that Armor provides per unit. </p>
<p>There's the part of the curve that is flat. Let's take a look at what happens from from 250 to 300 Armor. 250 Armor about <strong>70% Resistance</strong> and 300 Armor offers about <strong>75% Resistance</strong>. For 50 Armor, it's not much of a difference. Therefore, let's avoid the flat range because Flat Armor Penetration, unless backed up by a lot of % Armor Penetration, doesn't do much at that Armor range, and ultimately becomes a deadweight stat.</p>
<p>Then there's the part of the curve that is very steep. This time, let's take a look at around the 0-50 Armor range. 0 Armor <strong>offers 0% Resistance</strong> and 50 Armor offers about <strong>35% Resistance</strong>. For just 50 Armor, resistance jumped up from about <strong>0% to 35%</strong>! This is where we want to be. This is the Sweet Spot. We want to Armor Penetrate as close as we can to 0 Armor because if we can reduce the enemies Armor to 0, we will be doing True Damage and dealing damage optimally. </p>
<p>So how does this change the rules of the game when we are thinking of Armor Penetration? </p>
<h2>The More, The Better!</h2>
<p>If we build one Flat Armor Penetration item, we ought to stack enough of this stat to at least hit the Sweet Spot range where Armor Penetration is most potent. </p>
<p>Say for example, if our target enemy has 100 Armor. We only have one source of Armor Penetration - Youmu's Ghostblade. We only reduce the target enemies Armor to 180. However, we are in the flat zone of the curve...  The 20 Flat Armor Penetration from Youmu's Ghost Blade doesn't see a steep curve from 100 Armor to 80 Armor; thus, the difference in damage is close to zilch and becomes a deadweight item. The solution? More Armor Penetration!</p>
<p>Let's add Last Whisper to our inventory this time, which offers 35% Armor Penetration. When we hit our 100 Armor target, Last Whisper brings the target Armor to 65. From there, Youmu's Ghostblade will reduce it to 45 Armor! Now we're talking. We're in the Sweet Spot, and that's where we want to be.</p>
<p>We clearly see that stacking Armor Penetration items increases the potency of every other Armor Penetration items we have. However, what most people in current meta end up doing is selling their Flat Armor Penetration item for Last Whisper or Void Staff. This is because most people understand that % Armor Penetration/Reduction is effective against high-Armored target mid-late game, but they don't realize that Flat Armor Penetration becomes more effective by building more to hit the Sweet Spot. </p>
<h2>Champion Selection</h2>
<p>We should pick a champion that comes with innate Armor Penetration. A good example is Wu Kong's Crushing Blow, which reduces  the enemies armor by 30%, or Xin Zhao's passive that gives him 15% Armor Reduction. This will all help us reach hitting the Sweet Spot range.</p>
<p>Or we could pick a champion with high mobilty and damage to dunk enemy backliners that have low Amor in the Sweet Spot range. Some examples of champions that could achieve this are  Khazix, Le Blanc, Talon, Wu Kong, Master Yi, etc... </p>
<p>Or we should just pick a champion that has very low AD or AP ratio. An example with be Karthus and Xin Zhao with ratios as low as 20%. Because their AD or AP ratio is low, these champions would benefit much more from Armor Penetration stacking than AP/AD stacking.</p>
<p>When thinking of team composition, we might want to consider an AOE Armor Penetration team set-up. Examples would be Nasus's Spirit Fire which reduces enemy Armor by 40, Jarvan IV's Dragon Strike that reduces armor by 26% AOE Taric's Shatter which reduces Armor by 30% AOE, Corki's Gatling Gun for total of 40 Flat Armor Reduction AOE, etc... Wouldn't it be awesome when the opposing Summoners all have 0 Armor?</p>
<h2>The Set Up</h2>
<p>Make sure to get three points of Devastating Strike under Offensive Masteries for +6% Armor Penetration.</p>
<p>Consider Exhaust. It is effective with an Armor Penetration build because Exhaust provides 10 Armor Reduction.</p>
<p>Get a full Armor Penetration page for 19 Flat Armor Penetration or 14 Flat Magic Penetration.</p>
<h2>Item Building</h2>
<p>If the enemy laner isn't stacking Armor, then take advantage of this situation and rush an Armor Penetration item to do True Damage. And continue build Armor Penetration appropriately so that we are penetrating to just 0 Armor. You may need a calculator for this! In the opposite situation, if the enemy is stacking Armor early, skip Flat Armor Penetration and rush % Armor Penetration, which is Last Whisper or Void Staff. </p>
<p>For a Magic Penetration build, we should buy (not in any order) Sorcerer's Boot, Haunting Guise, Abyssal Scepter, and Void Staff. A Deathfire Grasp is a great choice as well since its Active Damage will be augmented by all the Magic Penetration. If we decide to upgrade Haunting Guise, a Rylai's Scepter has would have great synergy. </p>
<p>For an Armor Penetration Build, we should buy (not in any order) Youmu's Ghostblade, The Black Cleaver, The Brutalizer, and Last Whisper. The Brutalizer stacks with Youmu's Ghostblade and The Black Cleaver, so it's a good item to purchase again for more Flat Armor Penetration. I generally buy Guardian's Angel after purchasing all said items.</p>
<p>Remember to build Armor and Magic Penetration accordingly to the amount of Armor our enemy has. If we can penetrate 200 Armor, but are fighting a target with 50 Armor, then we won't be dealing as much damage as we should. If we find ourselves a bit farmed and have enough Armor or Magic Penetration to do True Damage, then build other items, such as B.F. Blade or Deathfire Grasp.</p>
<h2>Maybe Overpowered...</h2>
<p>Combining all of our knowledge on Armor Penetration, let's see how effective we can become with a deadly combination of item choice, Rune Page Selection, Champion Selection, and Summoner Spell selection choice. Imagine it is mid-game, and there is a 200 armored enemy tank. We play as Wu Kong. We have 4 damage items: Youmu's Ghost Blade, The Black Cleaver, The Brutalizer, and Last Whisper. We also have a full Armor Penetration Rune Page. In all, we have a total of 59 Armor Penetration, 39% Armor Penetration (35% from Last Whisper and 6% from Mastery Page), and 25% Armor Reduction (from The Black Cleaver). Now let's see how low we can get our target 200-Armored tank too. </p>
<p>We use Crushing Blow on the target bringing the target enemy from <strong>200 Armor</strong> to 140 Armor (30% Armor Reduction). We then apply all of Black Cleaver 5x bringing the enemy tank's Armor to 105. We then penetrate by 39% bringing his/her total Armor to 64. And we have 59 Flat Armor Penetration bringing the tank to only a measly <strong>5 Armor</strong>! And just for fun, let's throw in an Exhaust for -10 armor to bring the target to 0 Armor :P. Now, we are doing TRUE DAMAGE to the frontline tank. That's <strong>3 TIMES</strong> more damage than if we had no Armor Penetration. To put that into perspective, having a 100% Crit Rate with Infinity Edge only gives 2.5 more damage. Having max Crit Rate costs a fortune. We're looking at about 10,000+ gold, BUT Armor Penetration requires less gold (9300 gold) to hit max Armor Penetration... <strong>OP!</strong> </p>
<h2>The Cons</h2>
<p>Armor Penetration sounds too good to be true... So what's the catch?</p>
<ul>
  <li>We should expect a difficult time CSing (especially under those towers..) as you will have 9-15 lower AD than the standard Rune Page.</li>
  <li>Mid-late game, we need to dedicate a lot of our item space to having enough Armor Penetration to justify even just having one Flat Armor Penetration.</li>
  <li>Because we dedicate so much item slots to Armor Penetration, this is not viable for tanks.</li>
  <li>Since Armor Penetration is best rushed early, we will be soft squish when entering the stage of mid-game.</li>
  <li>Not all champions are viable with Armor Penetration due to no built-in Armor Penetration skills or lack of mobilty. </li>
</ul>
<p>By properly stacking Armor Penetration, we make Flat Armor Penetration not only a strong early-game stat, but a viable stat mid-late game. We also expand our freedom to Assasinate backline and frontline targets as well.  Unfortunately, many people sell their Flat Armor Penetration/Reduction mid-late game because many understand this stat as being purely an early game stat. But they never realized Flat Armor Penetration/Reduction can be just as effective as it was early game in mid-late game. With the right ingredients, we can crack the shell to hit the Sweet Spot.</p>
