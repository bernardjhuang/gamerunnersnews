While both OMG and LMQ currently play in different regions, the former competing in the Chinese LPL Series, and the latter in the North American LCS tournament, both teams have played one another in the past. Up until December 2013, LMQ was still competing within the Chinese eSports scene. Currently, both teams finished second in their respectable leagues’ regular seasons, and third in their playoff series. 

LMQ was born from a merging of teams and several renamings. The Chinese scene being as tumultuous as nowadays, neither of the two teams is exactly the same in both lineup and skills, but a point can be made, that while there are differences in playstyle, active players and mentality, the two teams have a certain amount of experience of each other. Within the 2013 LPL Summer Season, there was a gaping difference between the two teams: 

OMG finished in first place with a 17W-4L record, nabbing them an 81% win ratio, and LMQ finished in 6th place with a 8W-13L record. Aside from the poor 38% win ratio, LMQ had an even worse record versus OMG - three games, zero wins. 

There next arena would be the National Electronic Sports Tournament, held from the 8th to 10th of October at an offline venue by NEST. Both teams managed to make it out of the group stage with a 2-1 record, and were paired against each other in the Semifinals. LMQ manages to scrape 1 win before losing the Best of Three against OMG.

<h2>Regular Season and Qualifiers</h2>

OMG managed a clean season within the LPL. Starting out in Week 1, they ranked 5th, realistically tied for 3rd place with EDG, LDG and SH Royal, as all four teams managed a 1-1 in their respective Best of Two matches amongst one another. Week 2 and 3 saw the team climbing up to second place and clinging on to it with an overall 2-1-0 record, boosting their league points to 8 in total*. Weeks 4 through 9 saw them clinging on to the 1st place position, with the exception of Week 6, when they were ranked 3rd. The final tenth week OMG made a clean 0:2 loss to Young Glory and fell to the 2nd place spot, ending the season with a 6-5-3 record and 23 points to their name. Overall it was a successful campaign for the team, which managed to stay within the Playoff-qualifying range of 1st to 4th place for 9 of the 10 weeks.

Afterwards, OMG continued on to the First Round of the Summer Playoffs. In a Best of Five match against SH Royal, OMG managed a hard 3-2 win to continue on to a 1-3 defeat against EDG. Falling out of the Winner’s bracket and into the Loser’s bracket, they again faced SH Royal, and again won with a 3-2 result.

*The LPL uses a point system, where each team plays all of the other 7 teams twice, in Best of Two matches. If the match ends 1:1, each team receives 1 point. If one team wins it 2:0, it gets 3 points, while the other team gets 0. Example: Young Glory had a 3-3-8 record in the LPL 2014 Season, which is 3 times 3 points and 3 times 1 points, equaling in 12 points and a 7th place finish. 

LMQ started off their campaign with a 4-0 first week**. Week 2 saw the American-based Chinese team take a plunge to 4th place after two losses - one versus Dignitas, and one versus Cloud9. Weeks 3 through 8 were stable as the team held on to their newly-acquired 2nd place spot, racking up 9 wins against 5 losses. During Weeks 9 and 10, LMQ boasted the 1st place spot with new 3 wins and only 1 loss, but fell back down to their final 2nd place finish after a 2-2 in Week 11. Although they had the same 18W-10L result as Cloud9, both teams managing a 64% win ratio, LMQ had a disfavorable 1W-3L record, which decided their final ranking.

With the Regular Season ending, LMQ faced its next challenge - the Summer Playoffs. Due to their 2nd place finish, LMQ was directly seeded for the semifinals, where it would face the winner of the quarterfinal match between TSM and Dignitas. After a 3-1 win which decided TSM as their opponent, LMQ were a part of one of the upsets of the season, losing the Best of Five match 2-3 to TSM, after having managed a clean 4 win 0 losses during the Regular Season against the same opponent. Having been relegated to the 3rd place Best of Five, LMQ were slotted to play versus one of the banes of their seasonal matches - Curse. Having only won 1 of their 4 matches versus them so far, LMQ managed a very tight 3-2 win over the Regular Season 4th spot team.

**The NA LCS uses a point system, where each team plays a Best of One versus each other team four times, and ranking is decided by win percentage, and in cases of a tie - head to head record if it is in one team’s favor, and if not - by a tiebreaker match.

<h2>The Setup</h2>

While both teams were their respective regions’ 3rd place seeds for the 2014 Season World Championship, fans had high expectations for both teams, despite their tough Group C opponents - Korea’s 1st place seed, Samsung Blue, and Europe’s runner-up seed, Fnatic. After a tough set of 11 matches, the final showdown was the 12th match between OMG and LMQ. Having started off the group matches with LMQ vs OMG, won by the former, most viewers still expected a tough match for LMQ, with the advantage being given by most to OMG. 

Up until that final match, the group had cemented its first and last place teams, Samsung Blue having a 5W-1L record, while Fnatic managing 2 wins for 4 losses. In between 2nd and 3rd spot were LMQ and OMG, both teams faring 2 wins for 3 losses. Had LMQ not faltered in their second match versus Fnatic, they would have been in a much more enviable position of a 3W-2L record and having the option of losing a game to OMG and then having a tiebreaker to decide the 2nd place finish. This, as we all know, was not the case.

<h2>The Game</h2>
  
The match featured a far from lackluster Pick and Ban phase, as both teams opted for interesting choices. While OMG favored more personalized bans against LMQ, removing Twitch, Jarvan IV and Rumble from their options, LMQ went along with the meta bans of Zilean, Alistar and added a Ryze to the group of disabled champions.

OMG picked a balanced team, featuring Maokai on top lane, Kha’Zix in jungle, Orianna on mid lane, and the Lucian and Janna combination for bottom lane. Featuring 9 Crowd Control spells in their lineup, OMG had a very potent combinations on their hands. Maokai’s teleport enabled them to control the map, while Orianna could create a myriad of combination possibilities thanks to the use of both Kha’Zix and Maokai. Lucian and Janna were both safe picks, as Lucian brings the needed damage to the table, while Janna contributes to their engage and disengage opportunities.

LMQ on the other hand featured a more poke and siege-oriented lineup in this match. Lulu on top lane, a questionable pick due to top lane mages faltering throughout the season, Lee Sin in the jungle, Xerath on mid lane, and a Kog’Maw and Thresh combination for bottom lane. The chosen combination of champions had both its up and downsides. Lee Sin, although a bane during the early game phase, had a lot less options due to the scattered types of champions being chosen, while Xerath and Kog’Maw gave options if the match were to continue into the late game phase. Overall the composition gave the team options to deter turret diving from OMG’s side and also gave them a fair amount of poke to use for sieging. 
  
Two and a half minutes into the game, a four man bait setup by LMQ in the top lane river bush gave them the first blood, their victim being OMG San on Lucian. DaDa had to sacrifice a flash, so as to not end up as a second present for LMQ’s aggressive play, which entailed a hard matchup between both bottom lanes, as San had also used up his flash and heal in his attempt to stay alive.

Shortly afterwards, LoveLing was caught out trying to steal away LMQ’s blue buff, but managed a swift escape, after being pressured by Ackerman and NoName. OMG were forced into a double jungle situation, as LMQ switched their bottom and top lanes, and initiated a freeze on top lane, which meant no experience would be going towards Maokai, although Lulu would suffer as far as last hitting minions versus the Lucian and Janna combination.

What followed was an early turret dive on bottom lane from OMG. Maokai, Lucian, Kha’Zix and Janna jumped the opportunity and tried their luck at Lulu and Thresh’s expense, ending up in a 2 for 1 exchange, after DaDa died to the turret. While OMG got 2 kills onto their jungler, LMQ only managed to receive one, and unfavorably going towards their support rather than toplaner. This would be the forbearing tactic to be used on to Ackerman’s demise and a lackluster game as a whole from the Lulu player.

Despite the interesting early game, it took OMG 14 minutes of play to take the gold lead. The gold difference would continue to steadily rise in OMG’s favor after a drake. Shortly after the 15th minute mark, the lead was established at a steady 22.7 to 21k gold. From there on, the team would feature a 4.6k gold lead at the 20th minute, 5.6k five minutes later and 8.3k more gold in their favor at the 30th minute mark. 

What followed was a pundit’s nightmare, as both teams waged a vision war, doing little to one another for more than 6 minutes until the faithful old Baron tug of war came, where a very close 50/50 smite situation came into play when Lee Sin tried to outsmite OMG. After a good kill and well-used reset, OMG managed to score kills on Kog’Maw and Lee Sin, both going to Kha’Zix.

While it looked like the 3v5 situation would mean lost inhibitors for LMQ and an attempt to stall, what happened moments later spelled out sure defeat for the American-based team, as a Maokai-Orianna combination coupled with a lurking Kha’Zix gave OMG the ace and just enough time to finish out this high-gold low-kill game.

<h2>Closure</h2>
  
While the American-based LMQ did stir up a lot of fans’ hearts, in the end, despite a good season and a definite growth within the team, OMG was a wall too high to climb. NA LCS fans will continue to hope for a miracle, as both TSM and Cloud9 are to face Korea favourites - Samsung White and Blue. Chinese fans will be happy to have a 100% confirmed team in the Semifinals, as EDG will face SH Royal, while OMG will have another tough opponent in the face of the Korean Regional Champion - NaJin White Shield. While OMG have the prospect of anywhere between 75000 upward to a million US Dollars, LMQ will have to buckle up, train hard and be content with the $35000 they won for their 12-13th place finish at this season’s World Championship.
