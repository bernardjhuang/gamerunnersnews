In many ways, this year’s end of the season changes have once again shown Riot’s gusto when their game’s stagnation is at question. On the 9th of October, Riot pushed forward the pre-season changes for the first time on the PBE servers. The multitude of changes are to say the least, mind-boggling - covering all aspects of champions’ individual strength, introducing new jungler options and changing the focus of the game by introducing various new mechanisms as well as changing old ones. 

After a brief period of testing and the subsequent temporary removal of those changes, they are once again back as of the 25th of October and shall remain until the beginning of the first week of November. Due to the gigantic amount of outlined changes, this article will concentrate on only a part of them. For the complete list of changes as outlined by Riot Xypherous, follow through to his [PBE Board post](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/9dG0ndq0-rough-notes-pbe). The post, among other things, shows a view into the PBE Environment team’s ideas, as it features a lot of follow-up updates and trashed ideas.

## The Jungle Beckons

Outside of the [outlined changes announced early October](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/5AN5oKRM-preseason-2015-experimental-jungle-changes), one of the more interesting upcoming changes, is the crab infestation that League of Legends is destined to acquire. 

![new jungle camp, called Scuttle crab](http://i.imgur.com/tVSeBbL.jpg)

While cute is not the first word that comes to mind, the new jungle camp, called Scuttle crab will be one of the most important changes for next season. It will be a non-aggressive neutral objective, which will spawn twice - once in top and once in bottom river, and patrol that river. It will actively run away from all champions and when killed, it will move to a precoded position to spawn a speed shrine that will provide vision and out of combat movement speed for champions that use it.

The scuttle crab will be an interesting new mechanism to exploit, as it will enable ganking, give numerous options when considering Baron or Dragon and provide some much needed protection. While the mechanism is still undecided, based on how the scuttle crab is implemented, it will definitely open up more room for tacticians to plan and enable some interesting power plays for the upcoming season.

**Blue and Red Buff** will not be shunned from the realm of eternal changes. Both buffs will spawn at 2:30, compared to the current 1:55, meaning junglers will be forced to start at a smaller champ before moving onto their desired buff. Aside from that, both buffs will see their durations reduced from 150 to 120 seconds. Due to the introduction of a shrine via scuttle crab, this might enable some new masteries including the Runic Affinity, which gives a 20% duration boost to all neutral monster buffs as well as shrile boosts. While it is a sketchy idea, it will boost durations from 120 to 144 seconds which might prove useful for buff-reliant midlaners and junglers. Now, besides the changes to Blue Buff, we have a completely remade Red Buff, that will give a more interesting set of bonuses once killed - 1% of your champion’s maximum health every 5 seconds, its burn damage now applies to Towers and there has been some changes to the scaling of both burn damage and slow. Up until now the slow that Red Buff gave was 5 to 15% for ranged champions and 8 to 24% for melee champions. Both of these will now see their maximum slow caps being reduced, and ranged champions will have a 5 to 10% slow, while melee champions will enjoy a 8 to 15% slow. The burn damage rescaling has lowered the minimum damage and upped the maximum damage, from the current 10-44 to the new 5-56.

For a more thorough explanation of how the Jungle has changed as far as clearing paths and itemization, we highly recommend these videos from StoneWall008:

The other big changes to objectives include Dragon and Baron. The latter will no longer grant health and regeneration, but it will give an Empowered recall, reducing the recall times to 4 seconds, as well as a massive heal and 8 second movement speed buff once downed. On top of these changes, the Baron Buff will buff nearby minions, giving them up to 90% of your movement speed, 80% damage reduction for melee minions and increased damage and range for ranged minions, as well as a massive increase to the siege minions range. They will outrange towers, and while their attacks will be twice as slow, they will be AoE and deal 4 times more damage to towers. Super minions will gain 75% movement speed when near enemies, in addition to 25% more attack speed. Dragon on the other hand will now grant ‘Dragonslayer” stacks, giving different permanent bonuses based on the number of slain Dragons. Stacks 1 through 5 in order will give - increased regeneration, increased AD and AP, increased movement speed, increased Health and last - a tripling of the previous bonuses. It will give less experience and will no longer grant global gold. On top of that, it will deal 20% more damage and take 7% less damage for every Dragon your team has slain. All of these changes will, undoubtedly, give a whole new meaning to both taken Dragons and Barons during the game.

## The Big Overhaul

The next big changes in store are aimed at the Towers. All of the towers - outer, inner, inhibitor and Nexus defenses will now have 2000 HP, and they will no longer gain Armor or Magic Resist over time, although their Attack Damage gain remains unchanged. Their current Armor/Magic Resist is set at 100 and the Base Tower regeneration has been reduced to 5 hp per 5 seconds from 15hp per 5 seconds.

On top of these changes, Inner and Inhibitor Towers will enjoy two new mechanics. The former will receive a shield, that regenerates 60 seconds after last taking damage and while present, passively gives a shield to nearby friendly champions. The latter will receive the mechanic called Beam - they will attack their target continuously, maxing out at 4 times per second, slowly ramping their damage from 100% to 260% over 6.5 seconds, and also ignoring their target’s armor from 40% to 100% for the same period. This ramp will reset when the Inhibitor towers change targets. 

![anti-splitpush and anti-siege mechanisms](http://i.imgur.com/u4CAaMu.jpg)

The combination of all of these changes will make it easier to determine your champion’s damage on a tower and bring new innovative anti-splitpush and anti-siege mechanisms to the Inner towers and a heavy punch for the Inhibitor Turrets.

## What else?

There are numerous other changes, both big and small, but we will go through just a few of them and we highly recommend that you review the original post linked in the beginning to go through what we’ve selected not to go through, especially the Stat Growth Per Level changes.

One of the more interesting changes comes to Death timers. Up until now, the timers would increase by 2% every 60 seconds, starting at 25 minutes into the game. From now on they will increase by 2% every 30 seconds, starting at 35 minutes into the game. A quick example would be to compare what theoretical death timers are at 40, 45 and 50 minutes into the game. Before the changes, if the starting death timer was 30 seconds, we would be outbound for 39, 42 and 45 seconds at the three marks. With the new changes, we will be outbound for 36, 42 and 48. While this will mean that up until the 35th minute mark, death timers will be unchanged, it will even out roughly around the 45 minute mark and death timers will be longer in the late-game segment. This will create a little bit more room for teams that are struggling before the end-game phase, but they will punish indecisiveness and bad calls in the later phases of the game. 

Other interesting changes include the inhibitor respawn times being increased from 4 to 5 minutes, minions no longer gaining armor or magic resist and instead receiving more health per level, a movement and resist bonus for teams within their own bases, a revamp of elixirs and much more.
