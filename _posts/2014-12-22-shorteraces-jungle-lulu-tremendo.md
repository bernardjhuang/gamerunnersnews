Welcome ladies and gentleman of the internet to another pro player analysis.

My name is Nicholas “Impulse” Doucet, and today we’ll be taking a look at ShorterACE’s jungle Lulu!

As one of the dark horse teams in the NA LCS Expansion Tournament, Final 5 caught my attention with their play. But I knew that in order to pull out a victory they would have to play some crazy stuff – and they did! When jungler Ryan “ShorterACE” Nget picked the Fae Soceress in their set against Team Coast, I was practically giddy with excitement. One of my favorite champions – and in the jungle no less?

And, yes, <b><u><i>I AM AWARE</i></u></b> that Final 5 lost the match and that the jungle Lulu was ultimately a failure. But the concept was so interesting to me and the theory so different to what is considered to be the “ideal” way to play the new jungle that I couldn’t help myself and want to analyze the theory behind it. A unique experiment, even when it doesn’t 100% work, will always be more interesting to me than even the most perfectly played “on meta” team – and if nothing else ShorterACE captured my attention with his bold new pick and the solid reasoning behind it. 

Unlike my other articles, I will not be analysing the game in this article: as mentioned, Final 5 lost the match and the jungle Lulu did little to deter that. As explained by ShorterACE himself, the lanes fell too far behind and Shorter was unable to punish Impaler for his aggressive play.

Therefore, I’ll make this a short and sweet look at the theory behind the pick and why it works, as well as how you can apply this sort of strategy in your own play.

So without further ado, let’s take a look:

## The Theory

![ShorterACE's Lulu Jungle](/images/content/shorteraces-lulu-jungle-2.png)
 
### Staying Healthy, Lulu’s Kit and Soft Resets

At the heart of what makes squishy ranged junglers like Lulu work is the ability to “soft reset” the jungle camps – that is to say, cause them to run back and forth without attack but also not regening any health (which occurs when the camp is fully reset). This is the exact same theory that was used by the Unicorns of Love’s jungler “Kikis” and his Twisted Fate, which was put on display at IEM San Jose only a few short weeks ago. 

Basically, by standing just at the edge of a jungle camp’s reset range and attacking, the mobs become confused and run back and forth a few times before totally resetting. This “soft” reset allows ranged jungle to still attack the creeps while taking minimal damage, compensating for their low health and armor by not allowing the creeps to attack them in response. 

![ShorterACE's Lulu Jungle Soft Resets](/images/content/shorteraces-lulu-jungle-soft-resets.png)
 
This works especially well for Lulu since most of her skills enhance the soft reset strategy. In combination with her Help Pix! (E) shield, soft resets allow you to stay quite healthy despite Lulu’s complete lack of sustain and the new jungle’s increased difficulty. Her Glitterlance (Q) gives solid area of effect damage and the massive slow help you kite the larger mobs around, while her passive significantly boosts her auto-attack damage. Interweaving auto-attacks between cooldowns is vital for greatly increasing Lulu’s DPS, which means faster clears and safer jungling. 

While it is not a perfect science and by no means will keep you at full health at all times, soft reseting is the mechanic which makes jungler like Lulu possible.

I would suggest watching the start of the game a few times to get a better idea of Lulu’s early clear, and especially when ShorterACE does the Red Buff around 2 minutes into the game – but above all note that soft resetting IS NOT EASY and requires a lot of practice to pull off well and consistently. That being said the rewards are great and it can open up a lot of possibilities for new junglers. 

### Counter-Ganks, Peace of Mind and Turning Aggression Around

So you might be asking yourself – Ok, with some skill and by abusing soft resets, jugle Lulu “works”. But why? What does Lulu offer that other junglers do not? 

According to Shorter, the main purpose of Lulu is to counter-gank – which in theory maker perfect sense. Lulu’s entire kit and playstyle is focused around arriving to the fight quickly and turning it around with her insanely high level of utility and protection abilities. Especially when picked into an enemy jungler who needs to commit all-in to get kills such as Pantheon (which Impaler picked in this case), Lulu’s suite of crowd control abilities and shields can easily keep her ally alive and swing a 2v2 (or 3v3) engagement on its head while denying kills to the opposing team.

![ShorterACE's Lulu Jungle Counter-gank](/images/content/shorteraces-lulu-jungle-counter-gank.png)
 
They key here is <u><i>punishing aggression</i></u> since Lulu herself is not really the ideal ganker: once her CC is expended her overall damage is low and her cooldowns are very long (especially without items). But what she is excellent at is capitalizing on opponent’s mispositioning or over-aggression by keeping them locked in that unfavorable situation until they have no hope of escape.

Basically Lulu is the very definition of a utility jungler, providing very little offensive potential but giving your laners a certain level of peace of mind and safety from ganks if played correctly.

That being said, none of this works if you fail to read the enemy jungler’s movement and cannot successfully predict where he will strike – this was one of the downfalls of ShortACE’s game-plan against Coast. Impaler was simply too quick in his ganks and snowballed too far ahead, while Shorter was never in a proper position to use Lulu’s conter-gank potential to its fullest. Without laners who can stay alive until Lulu arrives, her purpose is all but nullified.

All this is to say that vision control is of the utmost importance when playing Lulu as well as effective communication with your teammates. Without a good idea of the enemy jungler’s movements, Lulu offers little to a team in terms of aggressive ganking potential and can quickly fall behind the pace of the game. But if played effectively Lulu can totally shut down enemy aggression and keep your laners alive even in the direst of situations. 

### Channeling CLG: Protect the Carry

![ShorterACE's Lulu Jungle](/images/content/shorteraces-lulu-jungle-champ-select.png)
 
So now we understand the why and how, all that remains is to answer the <i>when</i>. 

The answer this question seems to answer itself: to protect your carries. It was the purpose of the solo-lane Lulu, it’s the purpose of jungle Lulu. Look at how Final 5 pick the Lulu into a heavy dive composition out of Coast – when faced with Ahri, Pantheons and Lissandra the combination of Janna and Lulu is chosen to protect the generally immobile carries of Twisted Fate and Caitlyn. 

If Lulu’s early game job it to counter gank and keep your lanes safe, her late-game and teamfight job is to keep her carries alive no matter what. 

That being said I find it hard to recommend Lulu into a “one-core” composition – that is to say a team comp with only one major damage dealer. Lulu’s damage is relatively low, and while keep carries alive is what she excels at she can’t really help carry. If your team looks like it might be lacking in damage, it might be best to pick Lulu another game. Sometimes, the best way to help your team is with damage; but in the right scenarios Lulu might just be what the doctor ordered. 

## By the Numbers

### Items:

This is the only part of this Lulu build that can be considered “standard” – other than the jungle item, little in terms of item choices should be unfamiliar to those who have even seen a solo-lane Lulu.

Starting with the Machete and heading straight into the Ranger’s Trailblazer (as is the current standard) works best on Lulu. The Sorcerer’s enchantment gives Lulu a nice mix of cooldown reduction and damage, and it the go-to upgrade for your jungle item.

Otherwise, Athene’s Unholy Grail, Zhonia’s Hourglass, Rabadon’s Deathcap, Morellonomicon and Voidstaff are all viable mid and late game options depending on how the game is going.

Lastly, the boot choices for Lulu are interesting – ShorterACE went mobility boots in his game, which seems to be the most logical choice. Since as discussed above Lulu’s main job it to counter-gank, the ability to move quickly between lanes and out of the jungle with mobi-boots is the ideal situation. Otherwise, Sorcerer’s Shoes, Ionian Boots of Lucidity, Ninja Tabi and Mercury Treads are all situational options. 

### Runes

![ShorterACE's Lulu Jungle Runes](/images/content/shorteraces-lulu-jungle-runes.png)

*Source: [Leaguecraft.com](http://leaguecraft.com)*

ShorterACE runs an extremely interesting rune page which is designed specifically for Lulu jungle – it’s very rare to see this combination of ability power, armor and attack speed for any other champion. 

Like we talked about, since a lot of Lulu’s jungle clearing power comes from using her passive to increase her auto-attack damage in between spells: in this sense, the attack speed runes make a lot of sense to boost her early clears and maximise early damage output. 

This page also contains a lot of flat AP, once again helping Lulu with her early game weakness pre-items (especially the first clear). It also adds a little bit of potency to her shield, which is key for staying healthy should the soft-resets not be ideal.

Lastly, armor is crucial for junglers, especially squishy ones. It’s no surprise to see a full set of armor seals to round out ShorterACE’s rune page.

While CDR runes might have been an option, jungle Lulu’s item path and blue buff typically give her near maximum CDR, making the additional runes useless. 

Overall this is a highly custom rune page but works together to give Lulu the best possible early start to the game by leveraging her auto-attack damage and defensive abilities. 

### Masteries 

![ShorterACE's LuLu Jungle Masteries](/images/content/shorteraces-lulu-jungle-masteries.png)

Like the Runes, the Masteries run by Shorter is a bit of a mish-mash between attack damage enhancement and spell power. Taking the full complement of attack damage and ability power masteries in Offense along with Arcane Blade once again helps enhance Lulu’s natural strong auto-attacks. The other choices in Offence simply boost Lulu’s damage across the board.

The choices in the Defense tree are all pretty standard for junglers and are especially good when using the soft reset strategy. The boosted health and reduced damage from auto-attacks are designed to keep you as healthy as possible.

## Lessons Learned:

**Playing to Purpose**: ShorterACE wasn’t just playing a pocket jungler for the sake of it – there was a clearly though out purpose in kind for jungle Lulu and a specific role to be fulfilled in the larger context of the team composition and game. Playing (and picking) to your role is what makes niche picks work. Don’t just throw out jungle Lulu willy-nilly: learn the role, practice, prepare, set proper Runes and Masteries and build correctly. Make Lulu’s strengths your core goal by counter-ganking and keeping your carries alive. All this will help you make even this unusual pick work. 

**Learning Soft Rests**: Even squishy junlgers can work in the new jungle – but it takes practice. Watch VODs, test in customs and learn how to keep yourself healthy when playing a jungler like Lulu. Being able to successfully and consistently soft reset the jungle really opens you up to a greater variety of jugglers and playstyles which can catch opponents off guard. But it all starts with the resets: learn them well. 

**Experimenting with Runes**: Looking at ShorterACE’s rune and masteries pages, it’s not hard to see that they are both totally custom for this specific pick. Just like in champ select, there is no “best” strategy. Change your rune pages for each role – learning to adapt, adjust and experiment with your runes and masteries and gaining a better understanding what each champion needs will make you a better player. In this case, leveraging Lulu’s passive with higher auto-attack speed is vital to making her work in the jungle. It might not be the first thing that comes to mind and it’s definitely not standard, but it’s what it takes to make jungle Lulu effective. 

Like ShorterACE, I hope you will show no fear in champion select. Despite the fact that his Lulu didn’t work as well as hoped in the end, learning from mistakes is at the core to becoming a better and more versatile League player.
