A new season means new carries – or in some cases the return to the top of the old.

Although Sivir never really *fell* out of the meta (she has been continually picked in Korea for quite some time), she has certainly gone through a renaissance period over the past few weeks.

So with that in mind, I thought it would be a good idea to briefly survey Sivir, and examine why the Battle Mistress has once again returned to the forefront of competitive play.

## Why Sivir?

With nerfs to other popular options such as Corki and Lucian, the latter of which has all but fallen out of competitive favor all together, new carries needed to fill the void left by these champions. 
The first was Graves, whose high burst damage and lane control nicely filled the niche Corki once dominated – the pick has already seen success early in the season at events such as IEM Cologne in the hands of Gambit’s P1noy (who’s play you can read about here) and is quickly becoming a top LCS pick.

On the other hand we have Sivir, who shares a lot in common with the now maligned Lucian: early push potential and a mid-game power spike which helps her team win crucial fights around objectives. But even more than that, Sivir offers a level of utility that few other carries can offer, and fits well into a wide array of team compositions.  It should come as no surprise then that Sivir has seem a rise in popularity in competitive leagues across the globe and has even enjoyed good success on the ranked ladder. 

But, as with any champion trends, it’s not always wise to blindly follow the pros. Understanding what makes Sivir a solid choice and how to play her is half the battle.

So before you go ahead and pick Sivir in your next ranked game, let’s consider:

![Bandit Queen Sivir](/images/content/bandit-queen-sivir-2.png)
 
### Strength: Pushing the Lane and Pressuring the Map

While it should go without saying, one of Sivir’s greatest strengths is her ability to constantly shove the wave with impunity thanks to Ricochet. With its relatively low mana cost and auto-attack reset, Ricochet makes pushing your opposing laners under tower easy right from level one.

Obviously the benefit of this is that it applied a tremendous amount of pressure towards the bottom of the map and allows your duo-lane to move a bit more freely. This makes the all-important Dragon control that much simpler and safer while simultaneously denying the enemy duo of the ability to join in quickly on Dragon fights. 

While shoving up leaves you vulnerable to ganks on occasion, the diligent warding which goes hand in hand with Dragon vision should keep you relatively safe from harm.

Learning to leverage Sivir’s inherent push ability and transitioning map pressure into objective control is central to playing her, and also one of the main reasons she shines so much in competitive play.

### Strength: The Power of Engage and Disengage

With mid-game teamfights around objectives such as Dragon and towers becoming more central to team victories, it makes perfect sense that Sivir would see a rise in popularity. Since fighting (or not fighting) in the mid-game is so critical to taking leads these days, engage and disengage compositions have become the two most readily used strategies in the competitive meta.

Sivir fits perfectly into both of these popular compositions – the team-wide mobility her ultimate provides can quickly swing the momentum of a fight in her team’s favor when chasing down opponents or forcing a fight, while on the defensive the speed is excellent for saving allies in trouble.

Either way, few carries offer the same level of utility in as wide a variety of situation as Sivir does: creating picks, forcing fights/objectives and retreating after a poor fight are things that Sivir’s ultimate excels at. Furthermore, the attack speed and movement speed steroid for your entire team allows certain champions to hit their power spikes earlier, making your teamfight that much better that much earlier.

With all this said, Sivir doesn’t fit into every composition – she is poor at sieging towers due to her relatively short range and lack of escape ability and her only form of poke, Boomerang Blade, has a high mana cost and cooldown, making her inferior to Caitlyn or Tristana is siege or poke compositions.

### Weaknesses: Team Dependency and Dueling 

Sivir is very much the definition of a team-fighting carry, not only providing a boost to her entire team but able to deal large AoE damage with Boomerang Blade and Ricochet. Basically, Sivir is very team dependent in order to reach her maximum potential, which makes her an excellent choice in pre-made 5v5 or competitive but a slightly weaker pick in Solo Queue. 

In this regard, Sivir is not without noticeable weaknesses – she has no inherent “escape” ability other than her speed, and Spellshield is a skill which must be mastered in order to block the correct enemy ability. While she provides the ability to engage or disengage easily, you need your teammates to cooperate and protect you in order to make Sivir work properly.

Lastly, overall Sivir is a rather weak dualist. Boomerang Blade is a rather slow-moving skillshot and her Spellshield does nothing in a straight-up auto-attack battle between AD carries. While she provides tons of utility, Sivir lacks the raw burst of Graves or the damage of Vayne.

Notice how Altec and Steeelback played their Sivir – they were rarely even in a lane alone for long. More often than not, they were moving around with their team, forcing fights and picking up kills rather than split-pushing. Simply put, Sivir works best when grouped, protected and able to use her ultimate to maximum effectiveness. 

## Deadly Duos: What to Pick with Sivir

While Sivir is perfectly acceptable in a wide variety of compositions, she does especially well with certain champions – most notably those who enhance her engage/disengage potential. 

Here are some champions to try in combination with Sivir that have seen play together at the top level - 

### Annie: 

![Bandit Queen Sivir vs Annie](/images/content/bandit-queen-sivir-annie.png)

The Dark Child has seen a resurgence in popularity over the past few weeks. These days, hard initiation is extremely valuable given the importance of mid-game teamfights, and a Talisman of Ascension/On the Hunt Annie is one of the best engage tools available in the current meta. The sheer amount of ground that the Sivir-Annie combo can cover makes it almost impossible for the enemy team to avoid an engagement if you want one, and the power of the Tibbers stun can win fights outright if landed correctly. Not only that, but Annie’s long range auto-attacks compensate for Sivir’s medium range, adding some much needed zoning potential to the bot-lane.

Used to great effect by both Fnatic and Winterfox, the Annie-Sivir combo is certainly one of the best bot-lane duos at the moments, and must be considered whenever you’re putting together a teamfighting/engage composition in your ranked matches.

### Janna: 

![Bandit Queen Sivir vs Janna](/images/content/bandit-queen-sivir-janna.png)

Nearly he complete opposite to Annie, Janna-Sivir fits well into any team composition that wants to spread out a fight to disengage from an all-in opponent. Between Monsoon and On the Hunt, it is extremely difficult for just about any team to successfully maintain a fight if you don’t want one. 

Janna also compliments Sivir’s safer, push-focused laning with her shield adding bonus damage onto each and every Ricochet while her Howling Gale can deter attempts to punish Sivir’s medium range. 

While not nearly as potent a lane or mid-game power duo as Sivir-Annie, Sivir-Janna nevertheless adds tons of utility and safety to any team which needs it while providing a stable laning phase upon which to build for the late-game. 

### Rengar: 

![Bandit Queen Sivir vs Janna](/images/content/bandit-queen-sivir-rengar.png)

As was demonstrated by Winterfox in their first match against Gravity, the Rengar-Sivir duo is a fearsome ganking threat. Adding even more movement speed to a stealthed Rengar is a terrifying thing, and is oppressive to play against as a squishy or immobile carry – as Keane quickly learned. 

We all know the pain of facing down a fed Rengar, and Sivir speed is just another way to ensure that he can jump onto priority targets to lock them down with an empowered Bola or assassinate them outright. Although it costs two ultimates, a Rengar-Sivir gank should net at least a summoner spell every time, and more often than not a kill. 

Note that this pairing requires even more coordination than a regular Sivir composition, since the two ultimates need to be used in perfect conjunction if you want to avoid showing your hand or alerting your gank target too early. But if pulled off successfully, this combo can truly snowball out of control (just watch the Winterfox game).

I hope this article gives you a better appreciation for Sivir, the Battle Mistress. While she may not be the best Solo Queue champion, she has a lot to offer in your pre-made team games and is definitely worth a look in the right team compositions. By making sure you take advantage of her utility and teamfight potential, you should have no problem taking Sivir onto the Rift and finding success!
