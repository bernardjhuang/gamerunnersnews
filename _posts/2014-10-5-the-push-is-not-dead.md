After the "epic" 4 game clash between the Chinese titans Newbee and VG that determined the fate of 5 million dollars lasted a grand total of 83 minutes (that is 20 minutes and 45 seconds per game), the whole Dota community was quite frustrated. So much, in fact, that people started reminiscing about the good old days when a PL would farm for 80 minutes before willingly going to fight.

<p>Since Gaben and Ice Frog are men of the people, 6.82 (relatively) quickly came to the rescue of the distressed Dota 2 fans.</p>
<p>The patch promises less early-game-centered pushing (because towers are harder to push and yield less gold) and much higher chances for a comeback even when you are behind.</p>
<p>On a pub level it seems those promises hold true, at least judging based on my experience. Almost all of my matches in the new patch have gone to the late game. In fact, a surprisingly large number even included a couple of Divine Rapiers. </p>
<p>When you think about it, it makes sense. With the new bounty changes the leading team has a much smaller margin for errors. And in pubs people tend to make said errors, overextending and throwing, which quickly diminishes any lead and makes for an even game that goes late. More often than not, the team that has the better late game team fight composition wins. The proof is the rising pub win rate of heroes like Spectre and Omniknight.</p>

<h2>Is this going to happen in pro Dota?</h2>
<p>First of all, the fact that the comeback potential is much higher is most certainly going to have an effect. It incentivizes calculated play if you are ahead and risk-taking if you are behind. This means that XBOCT will win fewer games that he was initially winning and more games that he was initially losing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this doesn’t mean that <em>you don’t want to get ahead</em>. Yes, when you fight with a net worth lead you risk a lot. But at the same time people are forgetting the obvious – when you fight with a big net worth lead you are fighting with a big advantage and chances are if you play well, you will be able to win the fight.</p>
<p>The old rules of Dota still hold true: if you win the early game you are able to acquire map control, which means you are able to outfarm your opponents, you are able to get pick-offs more easily and favorably force fights at more offensive positions.</p>
<h2>Why do you push?</h2>
<p>This takes us to the core of this discussion. Yes, the incentive for pushing has been decreased (it yields less gold). But was the gold the main reason to push in the first place? It was a part of it, for sure, but the real reason has always been and still will be map control.  If you lose all your towers in the early game, the map becomes dark. Wherever you go to farm, you take a much bigger risk. If you go too far away from your base, your allies aren’t going to be able to help you because they have no towers to teleport to. Because of this aiming to push down the towers of the enemy team is still a reasonable game plan.</p>
<p>People also underestimate the importance of farm. Winning a team fight from behind becomes pretty significant, yes, but it wouldn’t be enough if you were sitting in your base doing nothing while your opponents have been farming the whole map. In pubs, people are often going to become cocky, dive some towers and throw away that advantage. Most good pro teams, however, don’t have this problem and would use the advantage to win rather than throw it away.</p>
<h2>How will pushing strats change?</h2>
<p>The one thing that is probably going to change about pushing strategies is that the lineups will include good late game potential (going all-in on the early push is riskier now). You cannot push down all towers and then simply throw bodies at the enemy base until you get the Rax. In 6.82, even if you get one lane of Rax, it is not worth paying for it with the life of all net worth leaders. This means that after the initial push of outer towers, you need to be able to control the map, farm up, and finish the game when you are certain you are in the position to do so. This timing could come early, but it also could come later and because of this you will need to have late game heroes to lean back on.</p>
<p>This means that lineups like EG’s core Tide + core Pugna + core Jakiro will become quite risky because of the lack of late game potential. At the same time, heroes like Razor and DP will still be very powerful picks that are able to acquire map control early on but also stay powerful during the late game.</p>
<h2>The Deathball is here to stay…</h2>
<p>People are saying that the push deathball is going to die because one bad teamfight will cost you the game. Is this really the case, though?</p>
<p>Let’s assume your team is ahead in a game. What is the best play style to keep your advantage?</p>
<p>You basically have three options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first one is to sit back on your advantage and use your map control to out-farm your opponents. To do this, you spread out and farm all possible lanes and ideally both jungles. This might seem like a very safe option, but it has a weakness: you are very vulnerable to ganks. If you do this for a long time and the enemy team manages to smoke gank your carries multiple times, you are going to lose a lot of gold and a lot of map control.</li>
  <li>The second option is to try to constantly gank your opponents so that you abuse your map control and prevent them from farming. This is also risky, however. If you are trying to gank but your opponents dodge the ganks you are essentially wasting your time. Moreover, you might walk into a trap (bait) and lose your life – such deaths are incredibly costly because you are investing time searching for a gank and in the end instead of finding a kill you pay with your own life.</li>
  <li>The third way to play is to stick with your team and play 5-man Dota. Once you get an advantage, you go get Roshan and afterwards try to force favorable fights. The risk here is obvious – if you are the ones forcing fights your opponents will have the defenders advantage. If you fail in said fight, your opponents are back in the game. And if you are moving as five but you are not forcing fights, you are essentially not using the map efficiently and your opponents will catch-up with farm.</li>
</ol>
<p>All three options hide some kind of risk. This means that all three options are viable, depending on the situation. If your opponent have very good late game potential but currently lack team fight strength the right choice would indeed be to force fights as 5.</p>
<h2>Final words:</h2>
<p>Recently (before the new patch) I talked to a certain famous pro player about his opinion on the metagame and on the whole pushing shenanigans. I was convinced that the early game pushing strats are imba (it certainly seemed that way after TI) and that’s why everybody is doing it. He wasn’t on the same opinion, however. He was convinced that drafting a good anti-pushing/turtling/split-pushing lineup with good late game potential (something similar to the logic of the aforementioned KotL + Mag + PL) can work quite well against the 5-man pushing strategies. So why isn’t anybody doing it?</p>
<p>Pulling such a strategy off is incredibly difficult and it gives you very little margin for error, especially when playing against a draft with a lot of pushing potential. It requires very good coordination and incredible map awareness. To become good at such a strategy, you need a lot of practice which means initially losing a lot of games. With lots of tournaments continuously running, few big teams can afford risking something totally new – every loss costs money. The easier thing to do is to draft a conventional strong 5-man lineup and hope to out-play your opponents in the early game and consequently win the mid game teamfights and the game. 5-man Dota is certainly the least tactically complex option – you need to win your lanes, group together and take objectives.</p>
<p>None of this really changes in the new patch – the comeback potential affects all play styles equally. The hope for us as viewers is that pro players would feel they need to try something new because of the new patch, which will make the meta game move on to something fresh – I’m all up for seeing some Spectre and Omni in pro matches for a change.</p>
