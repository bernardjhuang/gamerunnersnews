Welcome to GameRunner’s look at Bjergsen’s Yasuo – today we’ll be analyzing the small things a pro player can do to make the most out of their champion. Bjergsen played Yasuo twice at the 2014 Worlds, going 2-0, and we’ll be watching both games closely to see what we can learn from his play.

## Dominating Lane and Helping Ganks 

### SK Gaming versus Team SoloMid: Worlds 2014 Group B, Game 2

Since Yasuo becomes such a dominant threat late in the game, especially in the hands of a player as skilled as Bjergsen, it’s important to understand how to effectively lane him. Gaining an early edge and leaping off to a good start can be the key to snowballing a game out of control and taking easy wins. 

With that in mind, let’s take a look at Team SoloMid versus SK Gaming from the Groupstage of Worlds – here Bjergsen demonstrates how to lane Yasuo to perfection and how best to take a lead and run with it.

Matched up against Jesiz’s Orianna, Bjergsen knows that the first few minutes will determine the rest of the lane. Jesiz has the ranged auto-attacks to harass him with and the ball provides an excellent zoning tool, and falling behind would be devastating. That being said, Yasuo has the pushing advantage and Bjergsen takes full advantage – he hits level 2 first and immediately presses forward, taking a good chunck of Jesiz life bar before retreating with a swift Sweeping Blade through the minions, Steel Tempest onto Jesiz mixed with two auto-attacks and then Sweeping Blade out. 

![bjergsen level 2 advantage](/images/content/bjergsen-level-2-advantage.png)

Right from level two, Bjergsen uses Yasuo’s high damage and mobility to set the tempo of the lane and put Jesiz on his back foot immediately. Just because he has the upper hand, however, does not mean that Bjergsen plays recklessly. He respects the burst of Orianna and the gank potential of SK’s jungler and uses his advantage not to kill Jesiz, but to zone him back and keep him down on gold and experience.

Yasuo’s early kill potential is high, especially with Bjergsen running Ignite – but why take the risk? Playing Yasuo is all about snowballing from lane, and Bjergsen knows that patience and lane control often pays off more than risky all-ins.

If there is one thing we can learn from Bjergsen’s Yasuo, it is **_patience_**. Notice how he always holds his Steel Tempest Tornadoes until the last possible moment, and rarely uses them to last hit. The potential knock-up is too much of a threat to Jesiz, and when Bjergsen has the tornado up he can’t get anywhere close to the creeps. Bjergsen knows that by holding his tornado, Jesiz becomes too threatened to approach the creeps, which nets Bjergsen free gold and experience while denying the same to Jesiz. Also importantly to note, Bjergsen almost never fires his skillshot tornado, but almost always triggers the knock up from the Sweeping Blade dash position. This activation is much more reliable and much harder to avoid for the enemy, and provides almost guaranteed harass onto Jesiz.

Even once he has a major advantage in lane, Bjergsen plays calmly and continues to dominate the lane not through kills, but through control. He never dives Jesiz or aggresses alone because he knows that he is ahead but doesn’t feel a need to force it.

Solo-queue Yasuos, take note: trading one for one when you are ahead IS NOT WORTH IT. The shut-down gold to your enemy and the potential experience gain is simply not worth giving away. Bjergsen demonstrates that while kills are important to a successful laning phase on Yasuo, it is still possible to gain, control and force a lead purely through smart laning and ability use.

![bjergsen setup advantage](/images/content/bjergsen-setup-1.png)

Another thing to take away from this early game is how Bjergsen eneables and assists his jungler for ganks. Like I said earlier, Bjergsen almost always triggers his knock up from the dashing position – especially with a jungler like Lee Sin, who is highly mobile, starting a gank off with an almost unavoidable knock up is the perfect setup for follow-up skillshots. Both times Amazing ganks, Bjergsen starts it off with a tornado (granted the second one was a skillshot, but that’s because he wasn’t in range for the Sweeping Blade). If your jungler does not have a disable, it’s almost always better to wait until you have the knock up before the gank comes in. 

Overall, there is a lot of small things to take away from this laning phase.

## Lessons to Learn:

**Waiting Wind** - Don’t throw your tornadoes without purpose; make each and every one a threat with a potential gank behind it. Use them as zoning tools to force your enemy back and strike fear into them. If you want to trade, make sure the minion line is in position for a quick in and out to follow up your knock-up. Patience is key to successfully laning Yasuo, especially against a ranged opponent. 

**Learning to Lead** – Just because you are ahead in a lane as Yasuo does not mean you have to repeatedly kill you opponent. Zone them back, freeze the wave near your tower and farm up efficiently. Use your advantage to control the map with wards and roam when possible. Bjergsen is a master at applying pressure onto his opponent without overcommitting or taking unnecessary risks – watch him carefully.

## Split Pushing, the Mid-Game and Closing it Out

### Samsung Blue versus Team SoloMid: Worlds 2014 Quarterfinals, Game 3

Part of what makes Bjergsen’s Yasuo play so strong is a deep understanding of how, when and where to split push effectively. There is a lot to learn from how Bjergsen applies pressure through split-pushing, but also how he leverages a lead to its full advantage to close out a game.

Let’s take a look at a few minutes from Game Three between TSM and Samsung Blue in the World Championship Quarterfinals for a good example of Bjergsen’s intelligence when playing a split-push Yasuo. 

At around ten minutes into the match, TSM is up about 2.5k gold thanks to a few early kills and a Dragon. Bjergsen is sitting at a respectable 79 creep kills and is 0/0/4 – not a massive lead by any stretch, but a respectable score to begin split-pushing with.
Notice how Bjergsen always moves to pressure the lane where Looper’s Dr. Mundo wants to farm. This is because he recognizes a heavy item disparity: thanks to the fact that Dyrus was playing Ryze this game versus Looper, the Mundo is completely unprepared to deal with a Yasuo since he itemized heavy magic resistance early. Despite the fact that Bjergsen has no completed items when he begins his split-push, the armorless Mundo has absolutely no possibility of contesting Bjersen’s farm or fighting him in a straight up one versus one. By the time Looper picks up a Chain Vest a few minutes later, Bjergsen has been able to hit his first power spike with a completed Static Shiv, cementing his dominance in the match-up.

![Early item disparity](/images/content/early-item-disparity.png)

Importantly, Bjergsen never plays too aggressive, but also doesn’t allow Looper any room to breathe by constantly shoving the wave to the tower. He wards his flanks carefully and backs often to minimalize risk while still keeping Looper busy at all times.

However in this game it is not only _how_ Bjergsen split-pushes that is relevant, but why. Heading into the mid-game TSM knows two things: without their tank Samsung White cannot even begin to think about fighting the three man squad of Amazing, WildTurtle and Lustboy in the mid-lane and that with Teleport, Dyrus is safe to farm solo in the top lane while still providing map presence. TSM fully exploits the power of their mid-game trio of Thresh, Jarvan IV and Lucian to control the middle of the map, pushing the late-game focused roster of White back and penning them under their towers.

By having Bjergsen split-push against Mundo TSM forces White into a lose-lose scenario – they can either move Looper away from Bjergsen in order to break the siege of Turtle and Lustboy on the mid-lane turret, which will allow Bjergsen to take the tier two bot, or they can continue to try and stall the game with Looper defending bot, giving TSM total Dragon and Baron control.
None of this would work however if TSM’s vision control was weak. Looking at the mini-map at around 13 minutes, we can see that just about every brush in White’s bot-side jungle has a TSM ward in it. This allows Bjergsen to push up all the way to the tier two tower without fear of a gank – he is able to use Yasuo’s inherent damage and mobility to dance around Looper, pushing into the tower and walking away without a scratch. 

![Bjergsen securing tower](/images/content/bjergsen-securing-tower.png)

One of the most common mistakes for solo-queue split-pusher is not knowing when to stop or when to group with the team again. Here, Bjergsen once again demonstrates his game sense and intelligence when playing Yasuo – take a look at 14 minutes into the game. With their eyes on the mid-turret, TSM calls for Bjergsen to group with the team. Pushing one final wave into tower, Bjergsen heads up towards the mid-lane. There mere fact that he has left the bot-lane scares White back from the tower, and TSM takes it uncontested. Despite the fact that he didn’t actually contribute any damage to the push, the psychological fear that Bjergsen might be lurking in a nearby brush is enough to make White back down from the fight and TSM takes an unanswered objective. A similar situation occurs at 17 minutes as TSM takes the Dragon. The mere presence of Bjergsen in the vicinity is enough to deny White any chance of fighting for the objective. 

A split-pushing Yasuo quickly gains enough gold and experience to become a real threat – but Bjergsen also understands the power a Yasuo can hold in a teamfight, and wisely breaks off his split-push to support his team in key moments. Knowing when to join your team to secure objectives and when to make your presence felt across the map is a key factor in playing a great Yasuo. 
By pushing out his lane and then grouping with his team, Bjergsen gets the best of both worlds and TSM is able to close out the game without risk.

To recap, let’s take a look at what insight we can gain from this match.

## Lessons to Learn:

**Recognise Items** – Don’t try and split-push into a full armor tank. Exploit weaknesses on the other team and search for a lane where Yasuo’s mobility and high damage can be used to maximum effect against a vulnerable low-armor enemy. 

**Ward Carefully** – Dying while split-pushing is almost never worth it. Buy wards to place in the jungle and keep a carefully eye on enemy map movements. Get your team to help you if you know you want to split-push. The whole point of split-pushing is to draw focus and create pressure on one side of the map, and without vision you’ll never be safe enough to do so.

**Work With Your Team** – This game is a perfect example of how split-pushing can be used as a tool by a well-coordinated team. TSM distributes their resources effectively and uses their mid-game composition to its fullest, allowing Bjergsen to pressure bot while the rest of the squad gains total map dominance and vision. It is crucial that the space created by a split-pusher is used properly by the remaining members for this strategy to be effective, but also that the Yasuo player recognises his limitations and groups with his team around important objectives. Communicate, plan and execute when playing a split-push Yasuo.

## By the Numbers:

### Items:

The standard school of thought on Yasuo has always been **Statikk Shiv** into **Infinity Edge** for maximum critical strike chance and burst damage in the mid-game. However as teams have become more adept at dealing with Yasuo in teamfights and Exhaust has become a much more popular counter-assassin option, the split-pushing Yasuo build has become much more common with **Blade of the Ruined King** as the second item. This gives Yasuo significantly more sustain in a fight and the ability to split-push more effectively with higher attack speed – while the large increase in damage is lost, this build is much more versatile. 

For the early game, **basic Boots** and two **Doran’s Blades** should be more than enough health, damage, sustain and mobility to get you to your first major item. Bjergsen almost always gets double Dorans before even beginning to build into a **Zeal**. Simply put, the combat stats of the early game build is too good to pass up.

While Bjergsen and many other professional still build **Infinity Edge** on Yasuo, they only rush it if they are significantly far ahead of their opponents. Otherwise, it is much safer to secure the sustain from **Blade of the Ruined King** before moving into IE third. That being said, a naked **Bilgewater Cutlass** can also provide enough Lifesteal (coupled with Runes and Masteries) to allow for a fast **Infinity Edge** is the situation calls for it. 

Boots are highly situational, and includes **Berserker’s Greaves** for better duelling, **Mercury Treads** against a high-disable lineup, or **Ninja Tabi** against Zed, Talon and other AD threats. A **Guardian Angel** is also excellent on Yasuo, giving him the resistances needed to jump into the middle of a teamfight and walk out alive.

When playing any assassin, it’s important to be flexible in your build and adapt to whatever situation presents itself. Looking at Bjergsen’s builds almost nothing is set in stone – he is always aware of what works best in each game and purchases his items accordingly. Especially when playing a highly effective split-pusher like Yasuo customizing your items builds is crucial to success.

### Skill Build:

Bjergsen’s skill build is very standard – Max Steel Tempest (Q) by level nine for maximum potential damage, Sweeping Blade (E) next and take one point in Wind Wall (W) at level 4. This gives you the best balance of damage, mobility and safety combined with your ultimate, Last Breath (R), at 6, 11, and 16.
 
### Runes:

Bjergsen uses a couple of different rune pages, each with their own purpose. I’ll highlight two here, one to use when laning against AD and the other against AP.

![Bjergsen Yasuo vs AD runes](/images/content/yasuo-versus-ad-runes.png)

The AD rune page obviously includes armor, with a full set of Blues and a Yellow or two. This provides a nice early boost to your armor when trading in lane. He also runs Scalling Health Yellow, giving you a small boost early but a good chunk of health mid and late game – very helpful when engaging in tight duels with the likes of Zed. Attack Sped reds provide a large bonus in early attack speed, which in turn gives you more Steel Tempest strikes since the ability scales off of attack speed. Last but not least are the Lifesteal Quints, which when combined with a pair Doran’s Blades give you nearly 10% Lifesteal, more than enough to get you through the laning phase without taking too much harass.

![Bjergsen Yasuo vs AP runes](/images/content/yasuo-versus-ap-runes.png)

*Source: Probuilds.net*

Against an AP mage, Bjergsen switches up his Armor Blues for Magic Resitance, which is pretty self-explanatory. Since mage champions rely on their cooldowns to trade effectily with AD assassins like Yasuo, Bjergsen smartly switches half to Physical Damage Reds and half Armor Penetration Reds – this helps him leverage his early auto-attack advantage and punish AP mages better when they have no cooldowns. Less, but stronger, Steel Tempest procs are the name of the game when laning against an AP mage since you want to harass when they have no cooldowns and then back away safely. The rest of the page remains unchanged with Scaling Health Yellows and Lifesteal Quints.

### Masteries:

![Yasuo masteries](/images/content/yasuo-masteries.png)

Bjergsen’s Masteries setup for Yasuo is once again quite standard – a 21 Offence, 9 Defense gives the perfect mix of damage and lane protection that Yasuo needs to become a killing machine. 

Dangerous Game in Offense is a must and can be a lifesaver in teamfights and duels. Since Yasuo interweaves his auto-attacks with so many spells as well, Spell Weaver and Blade Weaving are both extremely effective at increasing DPS. The armor penetration from Devastating Strikes is excellent in the late-game while the bonus damage from Martial Mastery and Brute Force are great for laning.
In Defense, Block and Unyielding are critical to reduce auto-attack harass when laning against a ranged champion. Recovery compliments Bjergsen’s Lifesteal Quints giving him plenty of lane sustain and Veteran Scars and Juggernaut help compensate for Yasuo’s early squishiness. 

Thanks for reading! I hope this look at some of the small things that Bjergsen does to make his Yasuo truly great was helpful.
