This article covers the optimum stat ratios for Caster-Type Bruisers. For Auto Attack-Dependent Bruisers, [go here](http://news.gamerunners.gg/lol/calculating-optimum-stat-ratios-2/). Caster-Type Bruisers include Champions that are, of course, tanky but rely on spells as their main source of damage. If you enjoy playing Champions like Wukong, Pantheon, Jarvan, and the such, then read on - this is the article for you!

To calculate the optimum Caster-Type Bruiser stat ratio, we will employ the same methods in the previous article - measuring the True Value or the Effectiveness of stats, and minimalizing Diminishing % Returns. For more information on Effectiveness, check the previous article (link). For information on minimalizing Diminishing % Returns, check the optimum Health x Armor Article (link). Finally, without further ado, let's begin with calculating the gold factor of stats.
