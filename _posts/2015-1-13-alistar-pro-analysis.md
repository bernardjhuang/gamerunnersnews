![How Pros Play Alistar](/images/content/alistar-analysis.png)

Alistar is a LoL champion, one who has been on the edges of the competition too much, but in our opinion, there is so much more to Alistar than what seems at the surface. During Season 2, Alistar was still dominant, but after that the popularity has somewhat worn off. We still see Alistar play in a weekly match every now and then, but it never extends to something more than that. 

Hachani and Mata have both used Alistar in the past, and enjoyed quite a lot of success. For Hachani, Alistar has been the champion with which he has played the second greatest number of times. Mata picked Alistar for a semifinal game against the Blue. During the Champions Spring 2014, Alistar was picked and banned for about five times in all. When the 4.12 patch was introduced, Alistar was chosen for six games right after that. In all these matches, we can see that Alistar played quite well. In the semifinal game, there might have been a few flaws, but like they say, it also depends on the pro who uses the Champion and not just the Champion themselves. Whatever the case, we do not think that the 40% win rate was justified in any way, and by the end of our analysis, you will agree to it as well.

## Laning Phase 

The best part that we like about Alistar is the fact that we can play up to his abilities in many ways. Hachani, who plays for KT Arrows, usually maxes Triumphant Roar (e), followed by Headbutt (w) at the second place. Mata who plays for Samsung White, also maxed Headbutt second. At the first spot, both players chose to max Pulverize (q). The laning is actually dependant on whichever ability is maxed second. One more thing to add here: the second maxed ability also affects the fighting capability of the team. 

Now, when heal is maxed at the second spot, the team fights in a more effective way. If Headbutt is maxed second, more control can be enjoyed through each and every fight. But when it comes to the laning phase, the heal is the best choice. And like we’ve already said, for achieving a fighting ability, Headbutt should be maxed out. 

## Healing Ability 

Coming on to Alistar, his healing ability is limited because Alistar usually zones the carries for the team. When we take a look at the games, both Hachani and Mata maxed Triumphant Roar first so that wave manipulation could be allowed. In the process, level two can be reached quickly because Alistar can minimize poke damage and heal the minions. In fact, Alistar can amass a huge number of minions, giving your lane immediate control of the situations. You can then use the opportunity to get ahead. We saw the same thing happening in the first game, which took place between Blue and White. DanDy destroyed the tri brush ward in just the first minute and ganked into the bottom lane.

## Pre Sixes ‘All Ins’

During the games, there were some instances where we saw Hachani struggling. For instance, consider the second set in the semi game. That was when T1S killed Hachani. Probably, this is because of the fact that Alistar’s pre sixes are riskier than his post sixes. He does not have free cleanse and tankiness, which is why his performance can suffer at times. You should remember this if you cannot see the jungler on the map. Mata did and he did not have to go through the same situation as Hachani.

Taking about pre sixes, it should be mentioned that Alistar is a pro at All ins in the laning phase. Watch the first game of Samsung Blue; you will know what we mean when you see Mata play.

The situation was absolutely perfect for White for a number of reasons, which we highlight below.

* White killed Deft in the early stages of the game, which put them at an advantage. Mata used it well and played quiet aggressively in the bottom lane, despite the fact that he gold was not sent at that stage.

* The map showed a fight starting between Sprit Evelynn and DanDy. Mata took the opportunity and charged at Deft with the Pulverize Flash. This minimized the animation, and Deft did not have a lot of time to respond. When you max out Pulverize first, you output the maximum damage possible and lower the cooldown. 

But what we learn form Hachani is the fact that Alistar is excellent when it comes to preventing enemies from flashing out their wands.

## Turret Dives

In a nutshell, the strongest phase about Alistar laning is the fact that he can turret dive the moment he hits the sixth level. With the release of path 4.11 Turret damaged gained per hit has risen to 37.5%, which demonstrates that Alistar is one of those very few champions who can tank turrets safely for prolonged periods in the early stages of the game.

Hachani used this quite well initially in the semifinal game. When Hachani reached level 6, the opponent team switched off their aggression. Hachani played around the map and kept T1S off their guards consistently. All this led to turrets and dragons, which put Arrows a step ahead in the mid game. 

## Headbutt 

Whenever we see Hachani play, we have noted that he always tries to use Headbutt against the opponent team. In the process, the player is stunned until the Headbutt lasts. The opportunity also gives a chance to utilize Pulverize so that control can be spaced over the entire crowd efficiently. We saw Mata use this in the third set of the semi final game.

Hachani uses the Headbutt quite well, but when Mata used it in the semi final game, he set quite an example. View this video and you will see for yourselves. His dive was one of the boldest things we have ever seen in any LoL game, and the fact that it came without warning, took the opponents by surprise.  Even though Mata tanked the tower throughout, he did not die.

## Roaming 

Roaming is chosen by any team for two main reasons. The first is to pick on the champion of the opponent team so as to get an advantage in the lane and achieve their objective. The second reason is that roaming allows wards to placed on the map in an attempt to control the vision. Sightstone rush is another way to do this, but we still like roaming because we can cover separate regions in this way.

![SSw Mata vs SSB Alistar](/images/content/alistar-analysis-roaming.png)

The best example of roaming with Alistar were seen during when Mata played again the Blue for the third time. Being in the lane with an imp is not so common, but less common that was the act that Mata chose to roam in the lane. White already had an extra member on the team. Mata give them additional advantage by giving more priority to the Mobility Boots over other items. His strategy allowed him to control the beginning part of the game, pretty much all by himself. Mata forced imp into laning one for a prolonged time period, but he still managed to keep up with his creep score, primary because Morgana does not have much pressure if the Dark Binding gets missed out or is in cool down. The situation made it safe for Mata to roam.

Now let is consider the Semi final game of Samsung. In Set three, Mata conjured up a vision of the game at an early stage, and played accordingly. Mata entered the enemy region when he noticed Dragon spawning. White seized the opportunity for creating a pick, even though they had no vision in the region.  Mata kept himself out of sight and roamed around the Blue’s Tri Bush, until he found the right moment to nail on Heart. A member on the blue team, Heart, did try to play back, but he was a second too late because Mata’s shield timed him out. 

Thus Mata played smartly and used the Pulverize for creating the pick. He secured the Sragon, and the Blues could not play against him and the Whites adequately.

## Team Fights 

If you want to start a team fight with Alistar, you should use flank. Both the side and the abaft flank are extremely effective if you want to use Alistar properly. If you try to initiate a fight from the frontal side, it will be hard because the mobility boots are often disabled, causing you to lose Alistar’s strength, which is his speed. Alistar initiations are dependent on the speed which you can never achieve from the front. Plus, when you initiate a fight form the front, reaching the backline is also difficult, which makes the strategy less effective. 

![Alistar Team Fights T1s vs KT Arrows](http://giant.gfycat.com/SpiffyShamefulBaboon.gif)

So how should you use flanks? Watch the game between T1S and KT Arrows for an example. T1S waited at the edges as KTA tried to take down Dragon. Hachani walked through the jungle and surprised Bang with his sudden Pulverize.  From then onwards, the tables turned into KTA’s favors. Hachani also picked Marin smartly to gain a further edge.

Since Alistar cannot always initiate a fight, he can be used for other roles as well. A great one of these is to absorb the maximum possible pressure and damage by claiming zonal control.

Now let us see how Mata used Alistar to initiate a fight. See the image on the right hand side.  Mata’s position was at the receiving end, because of which he was being forced backwards. He had no choice but to march ahead right into Dade and Deft, and compelling them to hit him. Note the picture: Mata is being targeted by three opponents while imp is targeting Acorn with his shots. Since Looper is zoning Spirit and Heart, imp is free to do whatever he wants. 

During the fight, Mata survived with the Face of Mountain, until the Pulverize had cooled down. This gave his team a couple of free seconds in which they gained control over Dade. Thus, we see Mata using crowd control onto the carries while still keeping the focus on himself. During this time, imp also got the opportunity to kill Acorn. Dade tried to fight back with a Pick A Card in an attempt to finish Mata, but his plan backfired, and he was killed in the process. 

Mata held the focus onto himself for as long as eight seconds, during which Imp enjoyed the easiest kill in his career only because Mata scarified. The only items which Mata used for his defense were Sightstone and Face of Mountain. Alistar helped him survived and give an extra 3 to 4 seconds. As long as you use Alistar wisely, you will enjoy the best every tank support.

## The Bottom Line

We find Alistar to be a promising champion, so why is the win rate so low? Both Mata and Hachani gave their teams a lead in three games; six games were played in total. The win rate is probably low because of the strategies which T1S and Blue used to fight Alistar. Their tactics were not very impressive. And Alistar’s win rate defiantly does not represent the way with which Hachani and Mata used him for creating picks and controlling team fights.

In the time to come, Alistar will be used more and more as the pros realize his capabilities. The Europeans and the Americans have both started to utilize him, and soon enough, we will see the Chinese do the same as well. Alistar will be the preferred choice of many champions, and will help their team win the games. 

So are you going to choose Alistar in your next League of Legends game? You will not be disappointed if you do!
