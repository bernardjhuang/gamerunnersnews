I hope you weren’t expecting a piece strictly about contemporary economics. This is an article warning Western League of Legends professional organizations and Riot to heed the warning that economics might give us. In League of Legends, the most important asset a professional team can own is a player. After the conclusion of the Season 4 World Championships, teams are scrambling to acquire new talent for their rosters. Now, more than ever, organizations are looking abroad to import players. One of the teams that made the World Finals, StarHorn Royal Club, brought in two Korean players, Choi "Insec" In-seok, and Yoon "Zero" Kyung-Sup. Although players *like* Choi "Insec" In-seok, and Yoon "Zero" Kyung-Sup have already been crossing borders to play for foreign teams for years, next season will go farther than ever before. Season 5 is the beginning of a new era and fans of Western League of Legends should not be excited.

## Increased demand for foreign players

The West has been struggling to find talent that is relevant in the highest levels of competitive play. Among Western professional players and journalists, there is a general consensus that solo queue talent is few and far between.  North America, in particular, has experienced this phenomenon the most. Apart from a few key exceptions like Euguene "Pobelter" Park and Johnny "Altec" Ru, North American teams have not been able to find promising talent from the North American challenger scene. LMQ, TSM, and C9 also failed to make it past the quarterfinals at Worlds 2014. Once again, the West has been "happy" to simply participate at the World Championship. Of the fifteen starting players North America sent to the Seasons 5 World Championship, only seven were North American residents.

This shortage or "perceived" shortage of native talent has led the West to look to Asia for imports. Europe's and North America's international performances have been amateurish in comparison to those of China and Korea for about two years.  A Korean team has won every major international for the past two years, and a Chinese team has taken second when present.  As American and European teams enviously watched Starhorn Royal Club blaze their way to the finals of the 2014 World Championships, one must think they wanted to have brought over their own "insec" and "Zero". "Western organizations have developed distaste for domestic players and a strong desire for foreign talent. 

## The Korean Implosion

Since the inception of Korea's "The Champions" tournament, a two-team system has been in place.  All of the major organizations like SK Telecom, CJ Corporation, and Samsung sponsor two teams. Samsung, the main sponsor of "Samsung White" and "Samsung Blue" sent two teams to the 2014 World Championships.

This two-team system has allowed for Korea to bring up vast amounts of talent in its competitive Leagues. The two-team system allows for greater levels of infrastructure and resources that are available to players. However, recently OnGameNet decided to implement a single team system similar to that of the West's LCS. The introduction of this single team system will bring major change to the Korean League of Legends scene. Every Korean organization will have to drop one of their major teams. As a result, at least half of the current Korean professional players have been displaced. Korea is known for producing the best players in the world; they have won the last two World Championships and there is no sign they are slowing down. Some players will retire, some will play in amateur Korean leagues, and many will ship themselves to foreign professional teams. Some of the most notable players who have already left the Korean pro scene since the decision are Cho "Mata" Se-hyeong and Lee "KaKAO" Byung-kwon. Korea has a large surplus of talented players who are hungry for competition and don’t have a spot in their native leagues. 

## What this means for the West
  
The West will be picking up Korean talent at a rate faster than ever before. Millennium has already shipped Ryu "Ryu" Sang-wook and Cho "H0R0" Jae-hwan over to Europe. Cloud 9 attempted to purchase Bae "Dade" Eo-jin. Countless other Korean players have expressed interest in moving to the West. Although picking up a Korean player would certainly be a short-term boost to many of the interested teams, they must be wary of the long-term effects. As the trend of Korean imports continues, the problem of weak Western Challenger prospects can only get worse.  If one were to compare this situation to a real world model, it would have to be Chinese manufacturing and American consumption.  China is the most dominant manufacturer of consumer goods in the world.  Because China is so efficient at manufacturing quality goods at low prices, the United States has resorted to purchasing them in masse. Although importing these goods is the cheapest and most logical choice of action for now, American manufacturing has fallen far behind and regressed. The infrastructure of American business is completely reliant on Chinese imports. This is nearly identical in nature to the current situation in League of Legends. Western organizations have developed a hunger for Korean imports and they will neglect prospects in Challenger teams and Solo Queue even more than previously. As the North American and European LCS become saturated with Korean players, native talent will be, understandably, discouraged from making the Challenger grind. As a result the overall level of native talent will fall and Korean imports will become even more necessary. This is a vicious cycle that will, eventually, shrink the pool of upcoming Western talent to unprecedented levels. 

## The "Interregional Movement Policy" is not sufficient

On October 9, 2014, Nick Allen released a statement titled "Interregional Movement Policy: Official Rule". In this statement, he outlined how Riot intends to deal with the problem of "Interregional Movement", or importing players. The most important excerpt from the entire document states, 

> "At least 60% (three out of five) Starters on any competing team must be Residents". 

While this ruling douses the flame of Korean imports in the Western scene, the fire persists. As time passes, the majority of Western teams are likely to recruit the maximum number of Korean players possible. If the number stays at 2/5 players, the LCS player base will be theoretically become 40% Korean. Even with Riot's restraints on "Interregional Movement", the Challenger scene will likely suffer. For every Korean player that moves to the West, the bottleneck restricting Challenger players from rising into the LCS becomes even smaller. If the bottleneck were to become 40% smaller, it should be considered a massive failure on the part of Riot. Nick Allen, in the same document, states, 

> "The World Championship Event is intended to bring together the best teams from each region to compete (...) in a global competition. In order to foster this diverse global competition, nurture regional teams, excite local and global fans, increase participation from all regions, and ensure a fair and open championship". 

Riot does not want the North American LCS to become the 60% North American LCS.  Riot wants players from each region to compete, and so do I. Diverse competition between regions is captivating and exciting. Fostering local talent creates a dream for amateur players to strive for and extends the longevity of competitive and recreational League of Legends.

I do not know the answer to interregional movement. However, I do know that Riot's "answer" is not enough. Considering their stated goals of "global diverse competition", and a desire to "increase participation from all regions", they need to make a change in policy. Koreans *WILL* saturate the West and the Challenger scene *WILL* suffer. As a result, the enthusiasm for local leagues will slowly dwindle and life of competitive League of Legends will bleed out. Western teams will soon have a tag that reads, "Made in Korea". And as Coaches stare with amazement at their new Korean toys, Western League of Legends will slowly decline. *Hopefully*, this can be an economics lesson for the West.
