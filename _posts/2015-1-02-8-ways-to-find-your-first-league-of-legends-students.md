I bet you didn't know that you *could* make money because you know how to play League of Legends really well. 

LoL is the #1 most played video game in the world, sporting over 27 million active daily players and over 67 million active monthly players ([yes, that's 1% of the worlds population](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2k3vbe/in_one_month_1_of_the_global_population_plays/)). And, the popularity of LoL shows no sign of slowing down with 2014's LCS drawing 27 million viewers ([yes, that's bigger than the 2014 World Series of Baseball which averaged 15.8 million viewers](http://www.thepostgame.com/blog/futuresport/201412/league-legends-world-series-nba-finals)). 

More and more people want to get better at playing LoL because being in the Diamond or Challenger division is now a bragging right amongst your friends (and pro NA teams have 300,000+ fan bases). 

Where should you begin establishing your LoL coaching career, and where are all of the potential students? Here are 8 ways to start putting your League of Legends skills to work.

*Note: Many LoL coaches start off free, establish credibility with students, and then start charging money.*

## 1. **[Make a GameRunners Profile](http://www.gamerunners.gg/)** and Keep an Open Schedule

<a href="http://www.gamerunners.gg/coaches/32">![Find LoL Students by Making a GameRunners Coaching Profile](/images/content/get-lol-students-gamerunners.png)</a>

Here on GameRunners, we have 100s of students every month looking for help with their game. All you need to do to get in on the action is create a coaching profile and set your coaching schedule. The more information about your coaching style and how you think about the game, the better the chance you have that potential LoL students will select you as their coach. Our coaches who receive the most requests are the ones with the most details in their profile. 

Students won't be able to find you if you don't have availibities in your calendar so make sure to keep your coaching schedule up to date!

## 2. Post to the /r/summonerschool Mentoring Thread

<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/wiki/mentoring">![Get LoL Students by Posting to Reddit Summoner School Mentoring Thread](/images/content/get-lol-students-reddit-summoner-school-mentoring-thread.png)</a>

Summoner School (/r/summonerschool) posts a mentoring thread every week on Wednesday at ~10:30a pacific time. This is a **GREAT** place to post about your LoL coaching details - many students visi this thread every week to request coaching from mentors who post. The key to getting many students is being one of the first few mentors to post in this thread so <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/render" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bookmark your calendar for Wednesday mornings</a>.

Our coaches have lots of success in getting students when posting to this thread. The best way to get students is to follow the instructions posted at the header of the thread. 

You can find a list of the past & future mentoring threads here: [http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/wiki/mentoring](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/wiki/mentoring) 

## 3. Make a Thread in /r/lolcoaching

<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/lolcoaching">![Create your own thread on /r/lolcoaching or find threads of students](/images/content/get-lol-students-post-to-r-lolcoaching.png)</a>

[LoLCoaching](http://www.reddit.com/r/lolcoaching) is a subreddit dedicated to League of Legends students and coaches. Here, you can advertise yourself to potential students by 

* looking for threads that say "looking for coaching" and seeing if your skills and champions align with the student
* creating your own thread with a little background information on what roles you play and what champions you feel comfortable teaching

The community may be small for /r/lolcoaching but your thread will stay up for a long time since the volume of activity is quite low. You would be surprised how many students you will get by simply making 1 small post to this thread and having it stay on the front page for 1-2 months.

## 4. Publish Articles On [GameRunners News](http://news.gamerunners.gg)

![Publish Articles on GameRunners News to build a bigger audience for LoL Students](/images/content/get-lol-students-publish-articles-to-news-gamerunners.png)

Haven't you thought of writing a guide on how silver players can claw their way out of ELO hell? Or how about your approach to dominating the top lane (because at 2:15 you can see if jungler started red based off the damage already on opponent's top). Well, I'm guessing that you didn't write that article because you didn't know where to publish your article or who would read it.

We have a community news section that's focused on getting your articles published and viewed. Our current monthly active viewership is ~3,500 per month and it's only been growing ever since we launched. Your GameRunners coaching profile will be referenced in every article you write which will increase your exposure to students. Select articles are also emailed out to our entire community of 150+ LoL players.

If you have any ideas on topics that you want to write, or have LoL articles that you want published - don't hesitate to reach out and contact us at [news@gamerunners.gg](mailto:news@gamerunners.gg?Subject=LoL%20Articles%20On%20GameRunners%20News). 

## 5. Answer LoL Questions Quora and Link To Your Coaching Profile

<a href="http://www.quora.com/League-of-Legends">![Answer LoL Questions on Quora For Exposure to LoL Students](/images/content/get-lol-students-answer-lol-questions-on-quora.png)</a>

There are many summoners asking questions on Quora that are going unanswered. A very easy way to get your name out there is to simply visit the [League of Legends topic on Quora](http://www.quora.com/League-of-Legends) and show your expertise on LoL by answering questions like these:

* Why was Alistar banned so much in 2014 Worlds?
* What champions are good against Riven in toplane?
* In team fights, should Janna shield a tank or a carry?

On average, each of these questions gets ~400 views, which can be many potential students for you!

## 6. Create a LoL King Guide

![Find Potential Students by Creating a LoLKing Guide](/images/content/get-lol-students-create-a-lolking-guide.png)

LoLKing has a lot of LoL players who go to [find guides on how to play their favorite champion and role](http://www.lolking.net/guides/). By creating a guide on LoLKing, you can have access to the millions of impressions. In your guide, you can put a section which talks about your LoL coaching details.

## 7. Engage Twitch Streamers

<a href="http://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/League%20of%20Legends">![Engage Twitch Streamers to build lol student audience](/images/content/get-lol-students-engage-twitch-streams.jpg)</a>

Creating a Twitch stream is a hard approach to building an audience these days. However, watching the many people who are playing LoL on Twitch who have low rankings can be a great way to build up an audience slowly. You can watch their stream and offer advice to the player in chat, which can lead to students!

## 8. Facebook / Twitter

Sharing your coaching profile on Facebook and Twitter can be a way of getting LoL students in the door, but only if you already have friends who are interested in receiving your services. A good way of getting LoL students from Twitter would be to search "lol coaching", #lcs, or #alistar and reach out to fellow summoners!

If you have any other ways that you've gotten LoL students and would like to share, email me at [bernard@gamerunners.gg](mailto:bernard@gamerunners.gg)!
