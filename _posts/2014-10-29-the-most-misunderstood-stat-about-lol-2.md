Welcome to part 2 of Hidden Gems: Armor Penetration. Here, we'll be decoding the enigma that is Armor Penetration to unveil hidden OPness!

In [part 1](../../lol/hidden-gems-armor-penetration-1/), we gave ground to some of the fundamentals of Flat Armor Penetration/Reduction. We saw that this stat is effective against low-Armored target and outlined three keypoints to follow when thinking about making that Armor Penetration purchase.

* The first is that Flat Armor Penetration/Reduction is an effective early game stat when everybody has a low amount of Armor. 

* The second was that we should target low-Armored target which is the squish in the enemies backline.

* But realizing that we need high mobility to get in range of squish, our third keypoint was that Flat Armor Penetration/Reduction is effective on Assassin-type class champions that have the mobility to jump to the enemies backline where all the low-Armored squishies are. 

EZ PZ right? Great! Now we're ready to jump to the more advanced aspects of Armor Penetration.

## The Sweet Spot

<img src="/images/content/armorreturns1.jpg" alt="Armor Returns in League of Legends" >

This graph shows how much Damage Resistance that Armor provides per unit. 

Notice there's the part of the curve that is flat. Let's take a look at what happens from from 250 to 300 Armor. 250 Armor offers about **70% Resistance** and 300 Armor about **75% Resistance**. For 50 Armor, we're only seeing a **5% additional Resistance** difference. So if we had 50 Flat Armor Penetration, we would only be cutting the opposing enemies 75% Resistance to 70%. It's not much of a difference for a chunk of 50 Armor. Therefore, let's avoid the flat range of the curve because Flat Armor Penetration, unless backed up by a lot of % Armor Penetration, doesn't do much at that Armor range, and ultimately becomes a deadweight stat.

Then there's the part of the curve that is very steep. This time, let's take a look at around the 0-50 Armor range. 0 Armor **offers 0% Resistance** and 50 Armor offers about **35% Resistance**. For just 50 Armor, resistance jumped up from about **0% to 35%**! Compare to previously, the same 50 Flat Armor Penetration that only penetrated from **75% to 70%** is now penetrating from **35% to 0%**! This where we want to be. This is the Sweet Spot. We want to Armor Penetrate as close as we can to 0 Armor because the curve becomes its steepest falling to 0. And when we hit the 0 range, we will be doing True Damage and dealing damage optimally. 

**You may be thinking that **35% to 0%** isn't much; however, the numbers are deceiving. Say for example, we deal 100 damage to our target enemy that has no Armor at all. But now, let's say he/she now has 50 Armor. We would now be doing about 35% less damage, or 65% of our total damage, which is 65 damage. The difference? 100/65 = 1.54. So with that 50 Armor Penetration, we are dealing about **54% more damage**! 

So how does this change the rules of the game when we are thinking of Armor Penetration? 

## The More, The Better!

If we build one Flat Armor Penetration item, we ought to stack enough of this stat to at least hit the Sweet Spot range where Armor Penetration is most potent. 

Say for example, if our target enemy has 100 Armor. We only have one source of Armor Penetration - Youmu's Ghostblade.

![armor returns - lol theory crafting youmu armor](/images/content/armor-youmu.png)

*(image from leagueoflegends.wikia.com)*

We only reduce the target enemies Armor to 80. However, we are in the flat zone of the curve...  The 20 Flat Armor Penetration from Youmu's Ghost Blade doesn't see a steep curve from 100 Armor to 80 Armor; thus, the difference in damage is close to zilch and becomes a deadweight item. So... the solution we ask? More Armor Penetration!

Let's add Last Whisper to our inventory this time:

![armor returns - lol theory crafting last whipser](/images/content/armor-last-whisper.jpg)

*(image from leagueoflegends.wikia.com)*

Last Whisper offers 35% Armor Penetration. When we hit our 100 Armor target, Last Whisper brings the target Armor to 65. From there, Youmu's Ghostblade will reduce it to **45 Armor**! Now we're talking. We're in the Sweet Spot, and that's where we want to be.

We clearly see that stacking Armor Penetration items increases the potency of every other Armor Penetration items we have. However, what most people in current meta end up doing is selling their Flat Armor Penetration item for Last Whisper or Void Staff. This is because most people understand that % Armor Penetration/Reduction is effective against high-Armored target mid-late game, but they don't realize that Flat Armor Penetration becomes more effective by building more to hit the Sweet Spot. 

## Champion Selection
When thinking about Armor Penetration in relation to Champion Selection, keep these points in mind: 

-We should pick a champion that comes with innate Armor Penetration. A good example is Wu Kong's Crushing Blow:

![armor returns - lol theory crafting wu kong crushing blow](/images/content/armor-crushing-blow.png)

*(image from leagueoflegends.wikia.com)*

Crushing reduces the opponents Armor by 30%. This will help us reach hitting the Sweet Spot range.

* Or we could pick a champion with high mobilty and damage to dunk enemy backliners that have low Amor in the Sweet Spot range. Some examples of champions that could achieve this are  Kha'zix, Le Blanc, Talon, Wu Kong, Master Yi, etc... 

* Or we should just pick a champion that has very low AD or AP ratio. An example with be Karthus and Xin Zhao with ratios as low as 20%. Because their AD or AP ratio is low, these champions would benefit much more from Armor Penetration stacking than AP/AD stacking.

* When thinking of team composition, we might want to consider an AOE Armor Penetration team set-up. Examples would be Nasus's Spirit Fire which reduces enemy Armor by 40, Jarvan IV's Dragon Strike that reduces armor by 26% AOE Taric's Shatter which reduces Armor by 30% AOE, Corki's Gatling Gun for total of 40 Flat Armor Reduction AOE, etc... Wouldn't it be awesome if the opposing Summoners all have 0 Armor?

## The Set Up

**Make sure to get three points of Devastating Strike under Offensive Masteries for +6% Armor Penetration.**

![armor returns - lol theorycrafting - armor devastating strikes](/images/content/armor-devastating-strikes.jpg)

**Consider Exhaust. It is effective with an Armor Penetration build because Exhaust provides 10 Armor Reduction.**

![armor returns - lol theorycrafting - exhaust](/images/content/armor-exhaust.jpg)

**Get a full Armor Penetration page for 19 Flat Armor Penetration or 14 Flat Magic Penetration.**

![armor returns - lol theorycrafting - full armor penetration wu kong](/images/content/armor-pen-wu-kong.jpg)

With this set-up, we will be hitting the Sweet Spot much more easily.

## Item Building

**If the enemy laner isn't stacking Armor, then take advantage of this situation and rush an Armor Penetration item to do True Damage. For example, The Brutalizer:**

![armor returns - lol theorycrafting - the brutalizer](/images/content/armor-the-brut.jpg)

*(image from leagueoflegend.wikia.com)*

The Brutalizer is an extremely cost effective item that we can buy early. Though The Brutalizer does not stack, The Brutalizer's unique passive, which offers +10 Armor Penetration, does stack with Youmu's Ghostblade and the Black Cleaver. If we build these items in accordance to the enemies Armor so that we are penetrating to just 0 Armor. If we're using % Armor Penetration, we may need a calculator for this! In the opposite situation, if the enemy is stacking Armor early, skip Flat Armor Penetration and rush % Armor Penetration, which is Last Whisper or Void Staff. 

* For a Magic Penetration build, we should buy (not in any order) Sorcerer's Boot, Haunting Guise, Abyssal Scepter, and Void Staff. A Deathfire Grasp is a great choice as well since its Active Damage will be augmented by all the Magic Penetration. If we decide to upgrade Haunting Guise, a Rylai's Scepter would be a great addition. 

* For an Armor Penetration Build, we should buy (not in any order) Youmu's Ghostblade, The Black Cleaver, The Brutalizer, and Last Whisper. The Brutalizer stacks with Youmu's Ghostblade and The Black Cleaver, so it's a good item to purchase again for more Flat Armor Penetration. I generally buy Guardian's Angel after purchasing all said items. Of course, we don't have to buy all 4 of these items. Generally, 2-3 Armor Penetration items would be good enough for damage, but 4 is if we really want to optimize our offense to insta-gib.

* Remember to build Armor and Magic Penetration accordingly to the amount of Armor our enemy has. If we can penetrate 200 Armor, but are fighting a target with 50 Armor, then we won't be dealing as much damage as we should. If we find ourselves a bit farmed and have enough Armor or Magic Penetration to do True Damage, then build other items, such as B.F. Blade or Deathfire Grasp.

## Maybe Overpowered...

Combining all of our knowledge on Armor Penetration, let's see how effective we can become with a deadly combination of item choice, Rune Page Selection, Champion Selection, and Summoner Spell selection choice. Imagine it is mid-game, and there is a 200 armored enemy tank. We play as Wu Kong. We have 4 damage items: Youmu's Ghost Blade, The Black Cleaver, The Brutalizer, and Last Whisper:

![theory crafting lol - wu kong full build](/images/content/armor-wu-kong-build.jpg)

*(generated at leaguecraft.com)*

We also have a full Armor Penetration Rune Page. In all, we have a total of 59 Armor Penetration, 39% Armor Penetration (35% from Last Whisper and 6% from Mastery Page), and 25% Armor Reduction (from The Black Cleaver). Now let's see how low we can get our target 200-Armored tank to.

We use Crushing Blow on the target bringing the target enemy from **200 Armor** to 140 Armor (30% Armor Reduction). We then apply all of Black Cleaver 5x bringing the enemy tank's Armor to 105. We then penetrate by 39% bringing his/her total Armor to 64. And we have 59 Flat Armor Penetration bringing the tank to only a measly **5 Armor**! And just for fun, let's throw in an Exhaust for -10 armor to bring the target to 0 Armor :P. Now, we are doing TRUE DAMAGE to the frontline tank. Mathematically, that's **3 TIMES** more damage than if we had no Armor Penetration. And to put that into perspective, having a 100% Crit Rate with Infinity Edge only gives 2.5 more damage. Having max Crit Rate costs a fortune - We're looking at about 10,000+ gold, BUT Armor Penetration requires less gold (9300 gold) to hit max Armor Penetration... and we are doing more damage... **OP**! 

## The Cons

Armor Penetration sounds too good to be true... So what's the catch?

* We should expect a difficult time CSing (especially under those towers..) as we will have 9-15 lower AD than the standard Rune Page.

* Mid-late game, we need to dedicate a lot of our item space to having enough Armor Penetration to justify even just having one Flat Armor Penetration.

* Because we dedicate so much item slots to Armor Penetration, this is not viable for tanks.

* Since Armor Penetration is best rushed early, we will be soft squish when entering the stage of mid-game.

* Not all champions are viable with Armor Penetration due to no built-in Armor Penetration skills or lack of mobilty. 

## Perhaps The Dawn of a New Item Meta

By properly stacking Armor Penetration, we make Flat Armor Penetration not only a strong early-game stat, but a viable stat mid-late game. We also expand our freedom to Assasinate backline and frontline targets as well.  Unfortunately, many people sell their Flat Armor Penetration/Reduction mid-late game because many understand this stat as being purely an early game stat. But they never realized Flat Armor Penetration/Reduction can be just as effective as it was early game in mid-late game. With the right ingredients, we can crack the shell to hit the Sweet Spot. And many of the top-tier Summoners are starting to catch onto this secret.

In the previous meta, many Assassins, such as Kha'zix would rush a Ravenous Hydra; However, in the recent meta, I'm starting to see many Kha'zix and Talon stacking Armor Penetration instead of rushing a Ravenous Hydra in the Platinum to Diamond ELO range.  What can this mean? Perhaps, this is a sign that our community is beginning to understand the conundrum that is Armor Penetration, and perhaps we are seeing the birth of a new item meta that is Armor Penetration, Armor Penetration, and some more... Armor Penetration...!
