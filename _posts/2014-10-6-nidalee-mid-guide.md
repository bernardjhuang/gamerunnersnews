<h3>Starting Items Notes</h3>
<p>Doran’s Ring and two Health Potions are the ideal starting items as most champions you will be facing in the middle lane are AP champions. The second set of starting items (Cloth Armor, four Health Potions, and one Mana Potion) is ideal against AD champions such as Zed, Yasuo, and Talon.</p>

<h2>Core Items</h2>

<h3>Core Item Notes</h3>
<p>If you are ahead against your enemy lane matchup, Morellonomicon would be the best first item for Nidalee as it gives cooldown reduction, ability power, and mana regeneration. It also scales well into the late game due to its passive. If you’re enemy lane matchup harasses and bullies you, Athene’s Unholy Grail would be the ideal must-buy item because it gives magic resistance and the Mana Font passive for increased mana regeneration so you can spam your Primal Surge.</p>

<h2>Full Build</h2>

<h3>Full Build Notes</h3>
<p>Rabadon’s Deathcap is a must-buy item for any AP mage/assassin champions, Nidalee is no exception. Lich Bane gives extra damage, ability power, and its unique passive Spellblade which deals 75% base AD (+50% AP) bonus magic damage on hit. Void Staff gives ability power and the much needed magic penetration to shred enemy champions. Zhonya’s Hourglass gives survivability and a whooping 120 ability power. Its passive makes Nidalee invulnerable and untargetable for a full 2.5 seconds. </p>

<h2>Other Choices</h2>

<img src="/images/content/nidalee15.png" alt="nidalee item">
<img src="/images/content/nidalee16.png" alt="nidalee item">

<h3>Other Choices Notes</h3>
<p>Banshee’s Veil is a great alternative for Zhonya’s Hourglass as it gives health, magic resistance, and spell shield. Guardian Angel is also a great item for those pesky assassins that rely on their abilities, it gives armor and magic resistance and a great passive that brings the user back to life.</p>
<p>Do not forget to buy Elixir of Brilliance and Elixir of Fortitude if you have all the items you need. They give ability power and cooldown reduction, health and attack damage respectively.</p>

<h2>Recommended Runes</h2>
<h3>Bonus Stats From Runes</h3>
<p><strong>Magic Penetration</strong>: +7.83</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong>: +72</p>
<p><strong>Ability Power (Level 18)</strong>: +27.54</p>
<p><strong>Flat Ability Power</strong>: +14.85</p>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee17.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Greater Mark of Magic Penetration – x9</h3>
<p>Magic penetration synergizes well with Nidalee’s abilities as they deal magic damage.</p>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee18.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Greater Seal of Health – x9</h3>
<p>The Greater Seal of Health helps a lot of range AP champions in their lane phase.  This is now favored over Greater Seal of Armor because of the buff it receives. </p>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee19.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Greater Glyph of Scaling Ability Power – x9</h3>
<p>Nidalee’s abilities scale well with ability power and stacking ability power helps her dish out massive damage and improve her killing potential. The Greater Glyph of Scaling Ability Power gives more AP than the Greater Glyph of Ability Power at levels 8 and onwards.</p>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee20.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Greater Quintessence of Ability Power – x3</h3>
<p>The Greater Quintessence of Ability Power gives Nidalee a flat amount of 14.85 AP at level 1. The Greater Quintessence of Scaling Ability Power only surpasses the amount of AP given by the Greater Quintessence of Ability Power at level 12 and onwards. </p>

<h2>Recommended Summoner Spells</h2>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee21.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Flash</h3>
<p>Flash is a mandatory for every champion as it can be used as an escape utility (over the wall, trespassing terrain) or for chasing and hunting down enemy champions.</p><br>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee22.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Ignite</h3>
<p>Ignite is my main choice for the 2nd summoner spells as Nidalee needs the true damage and reduced-healing effect of ignite to kill of enemy champions.</p><br>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee23.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Heal</h3>
<p>Heal is a rather excellent alternative for Ignite. It can heal not just yourself but also a nearby ally and it gives a nice speed boost for escaping sticky situations or chasing down enemy champions.</p><br>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee24.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Barrier</h3>
<p>Barrier can be substituted over Ignite if you will face an enemy champion that counters you.</p><br>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee25.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Teleport</h3>
<p>Teleport has immense uses as a summoner spell. It can be used to position Nidalee before a teamfight, killing baron or dragon, helping allies in another lane, or just for buying items and then going back to lane. The downsides are the long cooldown and the long casting time.</p>

<h2>Matchups</h2>
<p>Nidalee excels in any lane but I’ll only be focusing in the middle lane. The list gives you insights on what champions Nidalee fare well against and vice-versa. I’ll only be including champions that are popular in the middle lane. </p>

<h3><strong>Strong Against:</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee26.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Lux</h3>
<p>Lux’s late game is outstanding but she has a weak early game. Most of her abilities are skillshots. Nidalee has sustain in her Primal Surge and Lux does not have any, abuse this by poking her down with your abilities and auto attack. </p><br>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee27.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Karthus</h3>
<p>Karthus is weak early game and in solo skirmishes. He needs lot of farm and his Q ability has a delay and his E ability does minimal damage early on. He is very squishy and has no escape mechanism.</p><br>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee28.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Orianna</h3>
<p>Orianna can be a pain if played properly. She has a shield to mitigate some of your damage and his Q ability has low cooldown. Fortunately, you can dodge his ultimate with your Pounce because it has a slight delay when casting.  But you have more abilities that deal damage.</p><br>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee29.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Ryze</h3>
<p>Ryze is the same as Karthus. He got a weak early game but a solid and terrifying late game. His skills have short ranges and you can abuse this by poking him down with Javelin Toss. He also does not have any escape mechanism.</p><br>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee30.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Twisted Fate</h3>
<p>Twisted Fate had been nerfed several times. He still got the global presence thanks to his ultimate. He doesn’t have any gap closers unless Nidalee initiate first with her Pounce.</p><br>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee31.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Xerath</h3>
<p>Xerath abilities have long ranges but all of them are skillshots. His ultimate roots him in place and makes him vulnerable to your Javelin Toss. He doesn’t have any sustain although his passive grants him mana from time to time. </p>

<h3><strong>Weak Against:</strong></h3>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee32.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Leblanc</h3>
<p>Leblanc is an assassin AP champion and deals massive amount of damage. Although the silence in Leblanc’s Q ability has been removed, she still can go toe-to-toe with Nidalee and kill her if all of her abilities are up.</p><br>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee33.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Yasuo</h3>
<p>Yasuo’s W ability blocks your Javelin Toss and he has a gap closer thanks to his E ability. He is also quite tanky thanks to his passive that grants him a shield. If possible, avoid laning against him.</p><br>
<img src="/images/content/nidalee34.png" alt="nidalee item">
<h3>Zed</h3>
<p>Although Zed is a melee champion, he can harass you with his W>Q>E combo. He is also an assassin which means he can instantly kill you when his abilities are up. Is possible, avoid laning against him.</p>
