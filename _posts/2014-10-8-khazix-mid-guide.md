excerpt: "Khazix is a melee champion and can be harassed easily in the middle lane due to the fact that most of the champions he will encounter are ranged. He got a weak lane phase from levels 1-5 because he still does not have the Evolved Spike Racks ability and the active invisibility from Void Assault. These runes will help him survive the lane phase from levels 1-5."

<h2>Ability Order</h2>

<p>Void Spike Khazix returns to the metagame as the nerf on his Taste Their Fear rendered the ability ineffective. Maxing out Void Spike gives sustain and can be used a long-range poke. The next ability to max is Taste Their Fear as it also gives damage and its evolved part makes it useful for picking off solo enemy champions. Leap is max last as it is only used as a utility; for escaping sticky situations or chasing enemy champions.  Void Assault should be leveled up whenever possible, at level 6, 11 and 16.</p>

<h2>What Abilities To Evolve?</h2>

<h3>Void Spike -> Evolved Spike Racks</h3>
<p>This ability is the first to evolve when you hit level 6. It is now more efficient than Taste Their Fear and it offers amazing sustain and poke for Khazix. Evolved Spike Racks slows enemies by 50% and grant vision of champions hit for 2 seconds. </p>

<h3>Leap -> Evolved Wings</h3>
<p>Leap is always evolved second regardless of what ability you evolved at level 6. When evolved, Leap increases range to 300 (a total of 900) and causes kills and assists scored by Khazix to refresh its cooldown. Now that is a great utility to have!</p>

<h3>Taste Their Fear -> Evolved Enlarged Claws</h3>
<p>This was Khazix’s bread and butter skill before patch 4.9 but now it is only useful to enemies that are isolated. The damage dealt to isolated targets was reduced to 30% (it was 45% before) and it no longer deals damage based on the target’s missing health. </p>

<h3>Void Assault -> Evolved Active Camouflage</h3>
<p>Back then, this skill was evolved as a substitute for Void Spike (Taste Their Fear was overpowered back then and Void Assault still has the damage reduction) but due to the removal of its damage reduction, it was overshadowed by Khazix’s other abilities. </p>

<h2>Recommended Runes</h2>

<p>Khazix is a melee champion and can be harassed easily in the middle lane due to the fact that most of the champions he will encounter are ranged. He got a weak lane phase from levels 1-5 because he still does not have the Evolved Spike Racks ability and the active invisibility from Void Assault. These runes will help him survive the lane phase from levels 1-5.</p>

<h3>Greater Mark of Attack Damage – x9</h3>
<p>The standard marks for an AD champion, this increases Khazix’s last hit capabilities and it scales well with Khazix’s abilities. </p>

<h3>Greater Seal of Armor – x5</h3>
<h3>Greater Seal of Health – x4</h3>
<p>A mix of seal of armor and seal of health gives Khazix an early source of effective health. </p>

<img src="/images/content/khazix5.png" alt="khazix rune">

<h3>Greater Glyph of Magic Resistance – x9</h3>
<p>The standard glyphs for a mid lane champion, this covers enemy champions that deals magic damage.</p>

<img src="/images/content/khazix6.png" alt="khazix rune">

<h3>Greater Quintessence of Armor Penetration – x3</h3>
<p>This quintessence gives Khazix an early source of armor penetration and it synergizes efficiently with Khazix’s abilities as they deal physical damage.  </p>

<h2>Starting Items</h2>

<h3>Starting Items Explanation</h3>
<p>Doran’s Blade is the best item for Khazix as a starting item, the only downside is that you will only have 1 Health Potion. If you know that you will be harassed heavily, you could go for Long Sword and 3 Health Potion.</p>

<h2>Core Items</h2>

<img src="/images/content/khazix11.png" alt="khazix item">
<img src="/images/content/khazix12.png" alt="khazix item">
<h3>Core Items Explanation</h3>
<p>Manamune, Brutalizer and Mercury Treads are the must have item for Khazix. Manamune solves Khazix’s early mana problem and it scales into Muramana for more damage and a nice active. Brutalizer gives cooldown reduction, armor penetration, and damage for a cheap price. Mercury Treads gives magic resistance to mitigate damage from any AP champions (mostly champions from the middle lane are AP) and the tenacity is an added bonus.</p>

<h2>Offensive Choices</h2>

<img src="/images/content/khazix16.png" alt="khazix item">
<img src="/images/content/khazix17.png" alt="khazix item">
<p>These items are the best offensive choices for Khazix but you will likely to get 2-3 items from the set and the last is a defensive item. In my opinion, Last Whisper and Black Cleaver give Khazix a nice balance between armor penetration, cooldown reduction, and damage.</p>

<h2>Defensive Choices</h2>
<img src="/images/content/khazix18.png" alt="khazix item">
<img src="/images/content/khazix19.png" alt="khazix item">
<img src="/images/content/khazix20.png" alt="khazix item">
<img src="/images/content/khazix21.png" alt="khazix item">
<p>These items are the best defensive choices for Khazix. They can replace an offensive item if you want survivability or you want to be tanky. For the most part, getting Guardian Angel is the best option as it brings Khazix back to life.</p>

<h2>Matchups</h2>
<p>I’ll only be covering matchups that Khazix will have a hard time since most of the common mid lane champions have similar playstyle (Orianna, Twisted Fate, Nidalee). As far as possible, avoid these enemy champions or do not play aggressive in the early phase of the game.</p>

<h3>Annie, the Dark Child</h3>
<img src="/images/content/khazix25.png" alt="khazix matchup">
<p>Annie’s burst damage is one of the best in League of Legends. Her passive allows her to stun enemy champions and his E ability gives her armor and magic resistance. Annie’s abilities have short range but his Q ability refunds mana every time it kills a unit. Khazix will have a hard time farming minions from levels 1-5 but once he evolves his W, he can farm minions and at the same time harass Annie. Be wary at level 6, Annie can kill you with her abilities especially if her stun is available.</p>

<h3>Diana, Scorn of the Moon</h3>
<img src="/images/content/khazix26.png" alt="khazix matchup">
<p>Diana is a melee AP champion and most commonly seen in the middle lane. Although they are both melee, once Diana hits level 6 she can burst down Khazix or harass him with his W->Q->R combo. She has a shield so Khazix will have a tough time poking her down with his W ability. Diana also has a knock-up that can cancel Khazix’s Leap mid-air. </p>

<h3>Lissandra, the Ice Witch</h3>
<img src="/images/content/khazix27.png" alt="khazix matchup">
<p>Lissandra has an arsenal of crowd-control abilities. She also has that nice passive which allows her to cast an ability without mana cost. Lissandra could just use his W ability when Khazix uses his Leap. Her Q ability has low cooldown and her ultimate will root Khazix in place. Her Q ability damages enemies and enemies behind them which make farming minions a hard time for Khazix.</p>

<h3>Lulu, the Fae Sorceress</h3>
<img src="/images/content/khazix28.png" alt="khazix matchup">
<p>One of the hardest matchup Khazix will ever face in the middle lane; Lulu has the right skill set to counter Khazix. Her Q ability has low cooldown and has long range. Her E ability instantly damages enemies and grants sight of them, making Khazix’s invisibility thru Void Assault useless. When Khazix uses his Leap, Lulu will just turn him into an animal with her W ability. Lulu is also hard to kill as she has a shield in his E ability and can knock-up surrounding enemies with her ultimate. </p>

<h3>Syndra, the Dark Sovereign</h3>
<img src="/images/content/khazix29.png" alt="khazix matchup">
<p>Syndra is becoming popular this season especially in the competitive scene. She has a great lane phase and an excellent late game. She can harass Khazix heavily with her Q ability and she can also stun Khazix with her W ability. Once Syndra hits level 6, she can burst down Khazix just like Annie. Although Syndra is hard to play, a great Syndra player can crush a great Khazix player. </p>
