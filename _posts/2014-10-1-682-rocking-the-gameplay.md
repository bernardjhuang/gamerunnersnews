Few would be bold enough to push a groundbreaking patch amidst an ongoing tournament.
<p>Not a problem for IceFrog, the mastermind of DOTA.</p>
<p>Throughout the 8 years of me sticking around, from the rough edges of DOTA 1 (both in terms of graphics and strategy complexity) to the refined sophistication of DOTA 2, I've held nothing more but pure admiration for the Frog. An anonymous entity achieved mythical status amongst gamers, he's always had it clear: he wants DOTA to evolve constantly and will set himself no restrictions in doing so.</p>
<p>The 6.82 patch bomb dropped when iLeague was under way - IceFrog took the current meta, tossed it around, added a splice of unexpected changes and redefined the structure of DOTA 2.</p>
<p>Ok, this might be a slight exaggeration, but 6.82 surely brings forth a new era in the game both me and you used to know. Cloud9's EternalEnvy was not the only one to note this:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>dead game</p>&mdash; EternaLEnVy (@EternaLEnVy1991) <a href="https://twitter.com/EternaLEnVy1991/status/515325728276369408">September 26, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>But I wouldn't go as far as say that we're encountering the <strong>ded gaem</strong> phenomenon. On the contrary – with its rules redefined, DOTA 2 is to become more dynamic and at the same demanding in both pub terms and professional scene tournaments. Shadow Fiend's fiery arcana might serve as a symbol – IceFrog burnt down the remnants of past DOTA and wants to build something from the ground up (or close to it).</p>
<p>Enough of the sweet talk, let's take a look at the more important things which the patch brought by. There’s no way I'm going to encompass all of the changes, but I'll try to cover some essential changes from my viewpoints.</p>
<h2>The Big Kill Bounty Hammer</h2>
<p>Of all things newly introduced, the complete rework of the kill bounties is what became the most controversial change. Casual players, commentators and professionals alike stood on two shores as the one side demanded that the change ruins the gameplay and provides an unfair sanction on the leading team. The other side countered that such a change enables a more dynamic DOTA full of possible comebacks which rewards careful decision making and sanctions cockiness.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>6.82 Gold Formula</p>
  <p>-----------------------</p>
  <p>VictimLevel = Level of the Victim</p>
  <p>VictimNW = The victim's Net Worth</p>
  <p>EnemyTeamNW = Enemy team's total Net Worth</p>
  <p>AlliedTeamNW = Your team's total Net Worth</p>
  <p>NWDifference = ( EnemyTeamNW - AlliedTeamNW ) / ( EnemyTeamNW + AlliedTeamNW ) [Min 0]</p>
  <p>NWFactor = NWDifference * VictimNW</p>
  <p>1 Hero: Gold = 40 + 7 * VictimLevel + NWFactor * 0.5</p>
  <p>2 Heroes: Gold = 30 + 6 * VictimLevel + NWFactor * 0.35</p>
  <p>3 Heroes: Gold = 20 + 5 * VictimLevel + NWFactor * 0.25</p>
  <p>4 Heroes: Gold = 10 + 4 * VictimLevel + NWFactor * 0.2</p>
  <p>5 Heroes: Gold = 10 + 4 * VictimLevel + NWFactor * 0.15</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Since the coming of 6.82, though, there have been frequent follow-up patchfixes. In the beginning, the bounty/XP gain was a huge possible buff if teams lagging behind won a fight or two — IceFrog has toned this down a lot.</p>

<p>However, this concept is here to stay – it's just that IceFrog is tinkering around and trying to perfect it to fit in the current meta. Put in plain words, the kill bounty change means that if you're (far) behind the other team and manage to get a good fight or two, you'll have increased chances at turning back the game. Just like my last game (we were the Dire, so the red part of the graph):</p>

<h2> Two Runes </h2>
<p>Midlaners now won't compete madly over only one rune in their efforts to replenish the bottle. A new rune — the Bounty rune —  has been added and will always be present when it's rune spawning time. The Bounty rune's mechanics work as follows: </p>
<p><strong>50 XP + 5 * current game minute and 50 Gold + 2 * current game minute</strong></p>
<p>So for example, on the 10 minute mark a bounty rune will yield you: 50 + 5*10 = 100 XP and 50 + 2*10 = 70 Gold. While it doesn't seem like something spectacular, the introduction of the Bounty rune has multiple significant effects on the game.</p>
<p>First, it will come in handy for any 5 a.k.a the team's most devoted support who buys mainly wards, smokes and dusts. The rune might even be of huge benefit to 4 position heroes, ensuring they keep on track.</p>
<p>Second, it now means that midlaners can now bottle a rune each given other circumstances are met (like a support from their team guarding the aforementioned rune). There is still the impact of a “functional” rune – by functional I mean one of the “old” runes, though. </p>

<p>Bottle crowing has been severely punished in line with the easier way to just go ahead and refill your bottle. The flying courier's base movement speed has been increased from 350 to 450 movement speed, but its Speed Burst ability now has a huge cooldown (40 turned to 90) and its duration is reduced to 4 seconds instead of the previous 20. The fact the the Speed Burst movement speed has been buffed from 522 to 650 doesn't help a lot in the long run.</p>
<p>The message is clear: stick to your runes, midlaners, and leave your courier. Oh, and by the way runes are now automatically replaced every two minutes if they aren't picked up.</p>
<h2>WTF?! Hero Updates</h2>
<p>There is really so much stuff going on with the heroes in 6.82. Aside from Shadow Fiend's long awaited model (sorry, Zeus, not your time to shine) or the sexy fiery arcana he received, we now have a couple of hero revamps. Not to mention DOTA's own Father of Dragons – Chen, worthy of some Game of Thrones cameo with his buff.</p>
<p>Captain's Mode has received two additions and has seen two heroes withdrawn from its pool. Legion Commander and Terrorblade are now a part of the CM pool. Both heroes are very dynamic in terms of gameplay and involve playing risky. Terrorblade is very strong in terms of current meta so I believe he will get nerfed a bit after the pros start drafting him in CM. Nevertheless, we'll see some fun moments with these two and some team restructuring to supplement their roles.</p>
<p>Bloodseeker and Phantom Lancer have been <em>hugely</em> reworked.</p>
<p>Bloodseeker's new Bloodrage now brings madness incarnate to any hero it's casted on. For 12 second the buff amplifies both damage taken and damage dealt by 40%. While it's risky, I find it a great way to give that free Decrepify to one of your squishy mages lurking in the backlines. </p>
<p>Just imagine a Lina with an Aghanim's scepter blasting 1750 pure damage piercing through BKB from 900 range.</p>
<p>Or any global spell like Zeus' Thundergod's Wrath, for that matter. In fact, you can see the effect here:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pCJMYUFMB5k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Bloodrite is another no-brainer with a cast range of 1500 and AoE of 600. If enemies linger on the ground for 3 seconds, they get damaged (pure) for 240 each. What's more important, though, is that they are silenced for 6 seconds (at max level). Cast Bloodrite, have a massive disable like Treant's ult, and reap the profits later.</p>
<p>Oh, and what about Rupture? It deals no initial damage now, but enemies have the effect on them for 12 seconds, a 33% increase compared to its old mechanics.</p>
<p>As for Phantom Lancer, I don't really wish to say anything. PL was a broken late game steamroller before and he has been buffed to oblivion to ensure he will now facemelt anyone. It's not even funny and my personal opinion is we will see him fall under the nerfhammer soon enough.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Hero Changes</h2> 
<p>Times are a bit sadder for two of the most frequent picks in 6.81: Tinker and Faceless Void. Void got his purple face nerfed a bit as Chronosphere no longer disables heroes’ passives caught in the spell and its effects don't linger for 0.5 seconds more due to a previous bug. </p>
<p>Tinker's March of the Machines now doesn't target magic immune units which means no farming the Ancient creeps anymore, but that's the lesser evil to those who love playing him. The main point is that the Ethereal Blade + Dagon combo was hugely nerfed and makes the teleporting-around-the-map and ratting his way to victory fellow less attractive (however still viable) for the middle lane.</p>
<p>Because Rikimaru has had a change as significant as Phantom Lancer and Blood Seeker, I consider him an even more situational pick than before. I don't really get his change yet and can't put my finger on whether he got buffed or nerfed. His previous ultimate – Permanent Invisibility is now a basic ability, starting with a fade delay of 8 seconds. It also includes a nifty HP regen. Blink Strike is now an ultimate and while it now has three charges meaning potentially more damage, I've always felt Rikimaru just needs to blink and stick to his target, utilizing his Backstab. Besides, in a generic fight, you could recast Blink Strike soon enough. A downside to early game farming is Rikimaru's damage nerf (-10 damage), but a Quelling Blade will help you perfect those last hits.</p>
<p>Even though I have always preferred to play Sven as a carry, playing Sven as a support is now an increasingly seductive option. Aghanim's Scepter will now add a 900 AoE effect to his God's Strength ultimate. In other words, beside buffing your allies for armor and movement speed with Warcry, you now have the option to throw in a buff of 80% of their base damage too. This works especially well if high base damage carries like Drow or Tiny.</p>
<p>Speaking of Aghanim's, I just have to mention the Father of Dragons a.k.a Chen. Chen now can use Holy Persuasion to target Ancient Creeps which effectively means that you can push forward with friggin Black dragons which are magic immune and have 2000 HP...oh, wait, forgot about the 300 bonus HP Holy Persuasion gives affected creeps. See you around, Daenerys Targaryen, there's a new dragon master in the house now.</p>
<img src="/images/content/holy_persuasion_ancient_creeps.png" alt="Chen Uses Holy Persuasion to Target Ancient Creeps">
<p>Legion Commander players will not be happy as Duel doesn't ignore passive abilities anymore. This means that carries like Phantom Assassin and Faceless Void are going to kick her ass a bit, or Slardar for that matter. The bottom line is that you need to carefully pick your dueling enemies now.</p>
<p>Huskar can sacrifice his blood more frequently (cooldown of 12 seconds fixed on all levels of his ultimate), but Lifebreak's damage was severely nerfed from 50% to 35%. I can't decide if it's a nerf or a buff yet. Yes, 15% is a lot, but a more frequent ultimate means easier chasing and it's not like Huskar doesn't have his ultra regeneration ability, right?</p>
<p>Pugna joins the Aghanim's scepter benefit crowd as he can now serve as a HP supply system for carries, draining his life into them. Throw in a IO in the mix, and if your carry (*cough* Tiny) doesn't wreck havoc on enemies it's time to advise him to take a rest.</p>
<p>The favorite rifle-wielding dwarf of pub players – Sniper, has received a nerf to his famous Headshot passive. Instead of a ministun (0.25 seconds), it now causes a 0.5 second slow (100% MS and AS). While some people don't think this is a nerf, I disagree – stun (and ministun, for that matter), is one of the most valuable assets a hero can have. With his long range, Dwarf was perfect for disrupting channeling heavy-hitters like Crystal Maiden, especially with Headshot piercing through Black King Bar. So in the end, this is a nerf.</p>
<p>Another pew-pew themed hero – Clinkz, just got freedom slapped across his bow. Searing arrows are no longer an attack modifier so you can pick a Desolator or a Helf of Dominator (bonus for having a dominated creep handy to cast your ultimate on it!)...or even a Mask of Madness to combine with Strafe's bonus 130 attack speed if you're feeling glass cannon-y.</p>
