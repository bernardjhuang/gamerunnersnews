## LoL Coaching Features

<a href="http://www.gamerunners.gg/coaching_profile/edit?view=details">![GameRunners Coaching feature updates](/images/content/gamerunners-updated-coaching-profile.png)</a>

### Click & Drag to Select Select Availabilities

<a href="http://www.gamerunners.gg/schedule/edit">![GameRunners draggable schedules](/images/content/gamerunners-draggable-schedule.png)</a>

Remember when you had to manually click on each slot to indicate an availability? **Well, those days are no longer!** We've made setting schedules a lot easier by letting you drag to select multiple time slots. 

<a href="http://www.gamerunners.gg/schedule/edit">![GameRunners active schedules](/images/content/gamerunners-active-schedule.png)</a>

Also, setting a schedule indicated to students that you have time slots available for coaching, which gets you better search visibility on GameRunners.

### Languages Spoken

<a href="http://www.gamerunners.gg/coaching_profile/edit?view=details">![GameRunners languages spoken](/images/content/gamerunners-languages-spoken.png)</a>

You can now specify the languages you speak and have it displayed in your coaching profile. This helps our worldwide community of LoL students to find the coach that speaks the language they want. 

### Requirements & Lesson Plans

<a href="http://www.gamerunners.gg/coaching_profile/edit?view=details">![GameRunners lesson plans and requirements](/images/content/gamerunners-lesson-plan-requirements.png)</a>

In your lesson plan, you can set the expectations of what students can expect from you. What's your preferred style of coaching?

* Replay analysis
* 1v1 coaching
* DuoQ
* Screen sharing
* Theory-crafting

Also, if you have any requirements from potential students, you can now indicate what you need from your students.

### Response Rates & Times

![GameRunners search response rate & time](/images/content/gamerunners-search-response-rate-time.png)

Coaching response rates and response times are calculated based off your last month of coaching activity on GameRunners. When you receive a coaching request from a potential student, we display the amount of time it takes you on average to respond to the request and what % of the requests you reply to.

This helps students have a better understanding of how long it'll take for a coach to reply and how frequently the coach does reply to coaching requests.

## LoL Student Features - Better Search

<a href="http://www.gamerunners.gg/coaches?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=&region=">![GameRunners search improvements](/images/content/gamerunners-search-improvements.png)</a>

We've fixed our search engine so that you get the most relevant coaches for the champions and roles that you are looking for. Coaches are now ordered by a variety of different factors including: how much of the profile is filled out, if they have an active schedule or not, their coaching response rate and response time, and other things.

## Future Things to Come

We've gotten a lot of requests from both students and coaches on a review system. Students want to know which coaches are highly rated and coaches want feedback on their coaching from students.

Another commonly requested feature is search filters. These filters will allow you to filter coaches based off languages spoken, rank, and other criteria.

And finally, we're working on internationalizing our website to Chinese and other languages.

If there's a feature or bug that you want fixed, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:bernard@gamerunners.gg">reach out</a>!
