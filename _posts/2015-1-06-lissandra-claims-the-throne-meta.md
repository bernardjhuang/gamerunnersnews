After being used in great effect in Korea, Lissandra has once again risen to popularity, claiming the throne of the top lane. In my opinion, Lissandra is the strongest magic damage oriented top laner at the moment. Lissandra has taken the role that Lulu left behind, she is an AP mage who provides a ton of utility when picked either mid or top lane. In this article I will explore topics such as the Meta, AP toplaners and their resurgence and Lissandra as a champion.

## What is the Meta?

**The Meta is when players follow an unsaid set of rules, which maximizes the chance of winning through the use of strategy, team composition, builds, etc**. The Meta is sometimes obvious but some parts of it may be hard to figure out. For example the most obvious example of the Meta is 1 top, 1 mid, 1 jungle, 1 ADC and a support. This is obvious as it maximizes gold income and is the most effective way to distribute players. When you choose to go double jungle or duo top, you are **breaking the Meta**. Champions can also be in or out of the Meta, champions that are in the Meta are **the strongest in the current circumstances**. This may be because:

* Other champions have been nerfed and they have become the strongest in terms of statistics.

* They may counter other champions that are also very strong in the current Meta. 

* They have been stealth buffed by the changing game. For example at the beginning of season 4, Mundo, Shyvana and other HP tanks were super strong. This is because the game was more late gamed centered, snowballing was nerfed & masteries fitted their kit. A more recent example was the jungle changes. Dragon changes allowed champions like Pantheon and Warwick to dominate. These changes in the Meta are not directly intended to buff certain champions but benefit them in certain ways.

The Meta is dictated by patches and skilled players learn to read the Meta from the patches to determine what champions are strong and what are weak. This gives them an edge and gives the more chances of winning. The Meta is different in different places due to how professional teams play in that region. For example the Meta in China is always focused on heavy team fighting while the EU Meta relies on snowballing the mid laner and letting him carry.

## AP Top Laners

For a long time, AP top laners have been dominating top lane. Seldom do we see a traditional top lane bruiser; the only one who can stand up to them is Irelia. AP tops are strong due to shifts in the Meta:

* Lane swapping has been occurring throughout season 4. Ranged AP laners with high clear such as Lulu easily defend against this.

* They do a lot of damage while being tanky due to itemization. AP tank items are plentiful, such as Rod of the Ages, Liandries Torment, Rylais etc. AD top laners are forced to choose AD/AS or tankyness first. This means that they will lose out on a certain stat, as the items that give tankyness and damage are not viable. 

* AD mid laners is in the Meta and a team needs some AP in order to force the enemy team to buy both resistances (MR and armor).

* They provide a lot of utility and CC. Champions like Lulu & Maokai provide a lot of CC and buffs for their team.

* Teleport is basically the only spell that is viable in the top lane at the moment. Champions that benefit from ignite are not suitable in the current Meta. Where AP laners benefit greatly from it since they can gank with their CC easily. 

* They can be flex picks and which gives the team an advantage in champion select.

* They have high ratios and low scaling. This means even when built with little AP, they hurt quite a lot. Champions like Jax & Irelia are basically useless in terms of damage until they finish a Trinity Force or Blade of The Ruined King. 

## Rise of the Ice Witch

Lissandra has been a prominent force during her release in early 2013. Typically favored in the European region, she has been lying in wait for some time after being crippled by a series of game breaking bugs. She has recently seen play in OGN and the western expansion tournaments as a top laner and a mid laner. Some say she is FOTM due to being used by Faker, but in truth, she is a super strong pick right now.

She has all the advantages mentioned above and most importantly she has **extremely strong pick potential** and has the ability to **completely nullify assassins**, which are in the Meta, by using her point and click stun. Her ultimate ability, Frozen Tomb allows her to **instantly freeze assassins in place**, locking them down and allowing the team to melt through them. This also **protects key players from being assassinated**. For example, when a Zed ults on your ADC, you shut him down before he is able to lay on any other spells. 

Furthermore, she has *incredible engage potential*. Glacial Path, her E ability, has 1050 range, which allows her to travel into the enemy team from a long range. Once she is there she has an AOE 1.5 second root which can lock down entire teams. However, the most important part is that she can stay alive in the midst of chaos. 

> Her ultimate can be self-cast to protect herself for 2.5 seconds, which can then be followed up with a Zhonya’s Hourglass if necessary. The 70% slow which comes with her ultimate gives her team ample time to wipe out the enemy. 

In terms of laning, **she is both a bully in a 1v1, and a strong 2v1 laner**. Her range abilities which do decent damage are on a low cooldown at the price of a considerably high mana cost. However, if her passive is used effectively, she is able to constantly sustain throughout the lane and apply constant harass on the enemy. In a 2v1, wave clearing as a breeze as all her abilities are AOE and suitable for clearing, her range allows her to keep up in CS and not fall to far behind. *She is also very difficult to dive post 6*. Her ultimate allows her to stay alive under tower and her E is handy to escape the clutches of the enemy team. This combined with her incredible lock down ability allows her turn the dives in her favor, and it is not rare of a sight to see Lissandra come out on top of a dive.

## Conclusion

I think Lissandra is here to stay and will take the position that Lulu once possessed. As a mage who is capable of being decently tanky and output high amounts of DPS, Lissandra will continue to be a strong pick. Lissandra’s utility ensures she can stay relevant no matter how behind she is. I recommend you learn the Ice Witch as she has strong carry potential for a top laner in SoloQ. Good luck on the Fields of Justice Summoner.
