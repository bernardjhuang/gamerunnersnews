Hopes are held up high – in terms of both top plays, quality infrastructure/scheduling and intriguing coverage, when it comes to a tournament with a prize pool of almost half million dollars. The World Cyber Arena (WCA) held in Yinchuan, China was no The International, but still promised to be one hell of a DOTA 2 ride.

It will surely be remembered by players, fans and casters alike – though not for these hopeful reasons I listed beforehand. I have not seen an esports competitive scene fail on such scale yet. WCA could be condensed to a ten page ebook titled “HOW NOT TO ORGANIZE AND MAINTAIN AN ESPORTS EVENT” (caps lock intended and remains to stay).

And if I sound a bit pissed off, then I <em>might</em> be a bit pissed, all along with a horde of other people that had the displeasure to try and watch the tournament. Constant disconnects and server issues turned WCA into a frustration fest for everyone involved – to the point of utter desperation for some casters. I think KOTLGuy's reaction at the 00:45 second mark of this video encapsulates the feelings of all of us:

Na'Vi vs LGD was not the only match inciting such reaction. WCA brought the first tie in the history of DOTA 2 (and maybe DOTA 1 too?) due to such problems – a tie that happened on the Loser's Finals. I cringe when I try to picture myself as one of the people who purchased a live ticket to the event.

But you know what? Let's scratch this a bit and take a look at what happened, at least at the end of the tournament. I'll do a brief overview of the teams that participated in WCA and then I'll do an overview of the Loser's Finals and the Grand Final.

## World Cyber Arena Participants

Eight teams received an invitation to participate in the tournament. Four of them hailing from China – Vici Gaming (VG), Invictus Gaming (IG), LGD Gaming and this year's TI winner Newbee – the four others were Cloud9, Natus Vincere (Na'Vi), Alliance and Titan.

On October 1st, it was revealed that four players from Titan will join forces with ex-DK Mushi and play under the name of Team Malaysia.

The big surprise was that Evil Geniuses (EG) – who won the World e-Sports Championships (WEC) just a month ago, was not invited. For me it was interesting to see how some of the teams (*cough* Na'Vi, Alliance and C9 *cough*) would fare given the huge changes they've undergone after TI4. Sadly for Na'Vi, the downward spiral after the split with Kuroky and Puppey continues for them and they got eliminated pretty fast. C9, on the other hand, surprisingly beat Team Malaysia, VG and Alliance consecutively, reaching the grand final. They were also the only team to take a game off Newbee, who seem to be on a roll, winning yet another tournament.

## The First Tie In The History of DOTA 2 (and a frustration to behold)

The first clash between Cloud9 and Alliance on the loser's finals will be remembered for two things:

<ol>
  <li>The potential for the longest DOTA 2 match ever, beating the record of IG vs DK second match during TI3.</li>
  <li>The first tie in the history of DOTA 2 tournaments.</li>
</ol>

As for me, the first game between the two teams reminded me why I hate Naga Siren. There are a lot of ways to rat – you have Nature's Prophet, you had Phantom Lancer (not anymore since 6.82, both due to his illusions' rework and removal from CM) and you now have Terrorblade. C9 themselves showed where the power of the recently added in CM Terrorblade lies during their faceoff with LGD.

However, there is the single most boring and mind-wrenching hero to utilize when you want to achieve a tortured victory. Yes, this is the Naga Siren itself.

Loda showcased this perfectly in a game where his team was severely lagging behind. You can take a look at the XP graph to see for yourselves how much of an advantage C9 actually had:

![Alliance losing to C9 at the WCA](/images/content/c9-advantage-wca.png)

Alliance was so behind that Akke on the Enchantress had only Power Threads, an Aghanim's, and 2k gold around the hour mark. In a game that seemed to become the perfect stalemate: an overfed Siren who can't raze C9's racks against an Ember Spirit (FATA-) dealing a shit ton of damage without being able to counter her, boredom was about to hit record levels. Lacking action, the match was more in the veins of a stretched out lesson of psychological warfare.

Synderen started hopefully counting an imaginative number of duels (50) that were needed for Bone7 to get 1000+ bonus damage. We witnessed the first Ember Spirit refresher orb, a Lion (MiSeRY standing in for Alliance) buying 24 sentry wards… and a denied Aegis because all C9's heroes were already six slotted. On the 100 minutes mark three players had over 1000 CS, 7 heroes were level 25 and things started to get really stale.

Then the disconnect happened.

This prompted a decision I've never encountered yet as both parties entered discussions on how to resolve the game after hourlong attempts to reconnect to the game. A decision was reached to draw the game (1:1), effectively turning the Loser's Finals into a Best of 1 instead of Best of 3.

This was followed by another crash on the 7 minute mark of the second game. BeyondTheSummit studio and especially Synderen handled the situation perfectly, entertaining the viewers, but nothing could really be done in the end. After another painful period of trying to establish a connection, it became clear that the second game between the two teams will be played in a LAN lobby without the option for stream coverage.

## Deathpropheting Through The Grand Final - C9 vs Newbee

The grand finals were marked by yet another problem as some esports-related websites mistook the starting hour of the matches between C9 and Newbee. This is the reason I missed them, but luckily, there were VODs.

Since Newbee won the Winner's finals, they started with a win counted towards their side. This made Cloud9's task even harder given the fact that Newbee have been on a roll since TI4 and they are not an opponent you would want to start against with an automatic 0:1.

Things started good for Clown9 with FATA- (Pandaren Brewmaster) and Aui_2000 (Sand King) both getting fairly fast Blink Daggers around the 12 minute mark. EternalEnvy surprised me with a no-Plasma Field Razor. However, it was actually only logical – Unstable Current is a great counter to single target spells and Newbee had Skywrath Mage, Tidehunder and Lich as a lineup.

A badly planned fight cost C9 some of the advantage as both FATA- and Aui died and three heroes got to level 9 for Newbee. The Chinese got a bit overconfident, though, and an overextend in pursuit of pushing the middle T2 tower resulted in C9 successfully accumulating 3k exp only a few minutes later.

I must say that both in this first game and the game to come after, C9 had a pretty steady mid game. They made some mistakes, but ultimately resolved most of them by picking good fights.

When it comes to the late game, though, they encounter serious issues. This, and the fact that Specter is very powerful in terms of current meta, lead to them losing the game in the long run. Ok, I'll be fair – it was also the fact that Hao was playing on the Spectre. While he's usually a great player, WCA was his tournament by all means. Just look at the enormous difference between his Specter in Game 1 and EternalEnvy's Specter in Game 2 to realize this.

Combine this with Mu who is also in a great shape currently and goes absolutely mental when it comes to playing Death Prophet - and you have some two good reasons why it didn't work out for Cloud9. It also had to do with Cloud9 lacking any real damage aside from EternalEnvy's Razor. Newbee did a terrific job shutting him down and afterwards all that was left was to finish a somewhat struggling FATA- trying to prolong the fights with his ultimate, and a trio of squishy Nature's Prophet, Shadow Demon and Sand King. Which results in this:

![Newbee's late game slowly crushes C9](/images/content/newbee-late-game-beat-c9.png)

Game 2 saw some roles reversed with EternalEnvy playing a Spectre and Newbee's Banana going with Sand King. However, Mu was allowed to pick Death Prophet once again (which would have a great impact on what followed, along with Hao's Bristleback). I really have no idea why Cloud9 didn't just go ahead and ban the Death Prophet after the first game.

With some exceptions, Newbee dominated this one. I'm not sure if it had to do with Cloud9 feeling the fatigue of the ~13 hours of DOTA from the day before opposed to Newbee getting the much treasured pre-match rest. In any case, the combination of Hao's Bristleback, Mu's Death Prophet and a raging Lifestealer from Banana did enough to ensure the victory.

The “Second place” curse held true for Cloud9 once more in WCA. For Newbee, on the other hand, it was just another proof that the TI4 champions don't plan on lying around and taking a rest.

WCA had so much potential and I feel really bad that it was drowned in connectivity and server issues. I really hope the organizers learn from what happened and next time we'll be witnessing an event that matches the professionalism of the teams that participate in it.

Meanwhile, ESL New York is approaching – another promising esports event for all DOTA 2 fans. The competition will be fierce again, including participation from the side of a newly formed Team Secret. Combining the powers of ex-Na'Vi Kuroky and Puppey, ex-Alliance S4 and ex-Fnatic BigDaddy and Simbaaa, it will promise high class entertainment and action for all spectators.
