After a long and exciting World Championship, the time has come to turn our eyes towards November and the upcoming Expansion Tournament that will be held from the 15th of November until the 21st of December. Two rounds of online competition will be followed by three rounds of televised action from the ESL studios in Cologne and Burbank. There are only a few days left until the transfer season opens up for North American and European LCS teams.

Burbank ESL Studio

For the upcoming season, both the EU and NA LCS will get an additional two teams from the Expansion tournament, giving each region 10 teams. The 3 teams that lost out in the 2015 Season Promotions gain an automatic entry into the Expansion tournaments for each region.

## The Old Continent

For Europe, the 6 contenders that will fight alongside 7 more teams from Ranked 5’s are Millenium, H2k-Gaming, SK Gaming Prime, Reason Gaming, Gamers 2 and Ninjas in Pyjamas.

Ninjas in Pyjamas is one of the doubtful ones, as the roster that won the entry has since disbanded. If the entry is held by the organization, then they will make a new roster, and if it is held by the players, then at least 3 of the 5 players will have to be in a team, so that they may retain their entry. If not, they will be replaced by a Ranked 5’s team. Team midlaner Alex Ich has been linked to a new team, featuring Impaler, Kasing, Kev1n and Creaton. Freeze is, according to himself, a free transfer awaiting offers. The rest of the team has not voiced any opinions except for ImSoFresh, who shared in his facebook account that due to the short amount of time before the tournament, he would prefer to not go for it, so that the team may stabilize for next season’s qualifiers.*

Two of the top contenders -H2k and Gamers 2 have made no changes and look solid favourites for the clash. Ocelote fans are definitely praying for more luck for their favourite player and a comeback to the LCS tournament. On the other hand we have Millenium, who are very doubtful, as many rumours have spread about their team’s roster, yet the only 100% sure information there is currently, is that Kerp will not be continuing with the team. If in fact they feature a new team centered around kev1n, Impaler, Alex Ich, Creaton and Kasing, they will definitely be considered a prime contender.

The Polish home-grown team Reason Gaming is also feeling pressure for the upcoming tournament, as they have lost their toplaner Jokieez, who moved on to the new Polish team MSI Dragons. This leaves the team in a bit of a stump, but as Roccat confirmed that they would not be renewing their contract with Xaxus, he is a good option for them as a free transfer. 

SK Gaming Prime have been struggling to find a permanent replacement for Kikis, who left in September to join the new EU LCS team Unicorns of Love. No new information has come up since then, so who they might pick up as their jungler is still unknown.

The New World

So far we have six confirmed teams that will face another 7 that come from the North American Ladder. Team Coast, compLexity Gaming, Curse Academy, Denial eSports, Team LoLPro, and XDG Gaming will bump fists with the best that the Ranked 5’s queue can offer.

In preparation for their upcoming matches, Coast got themselves two new coaches - European ex-pro player wewillfailer and the old face in the team Elementz also returns. Their two most recent transfers were Cris as their new toplaner and LOD as their new midlaner, a definite talent boost to their roster.

compLexity Gaming had a tough season, falling out of the NA LCS and into the Expansion tournament. This ensued numerous changes to their squad in the beginning of October, when goldenglue officially joined as their new midlaner, while Pr0lly and RobertxLee were both benched. While there is no current official information, the rumour treadmill has been linking former TSM player Chaox to their roster as their new AD Carry.

Curse Academy have also made a few changes to their lineup, featuring Hauntzer in toplane and LCS veteran Cop as their new AD Carry. This lead to Cris and Impactful leaving the team, the latter still a free agent up to this day.

XDG Gaming have had no changes since acquiring their roster mid-August from Wazabi Gaming. By all means, i KeNNy u, Xmithie, BabyZeus, LattmaN and 10q will be trying their best to put XDG back into the NA LCS, with Xmithie as their only remaining player from their previous seasons.

After losing their old lineup consisting of Hauntzer, heavenTime, LOD, zignature and Patoy, Team LoLPro is currently running a new roster - Flaresz in Top, Thinkcard in the Jungle, Yusui as their new Midlaner, and the WizFujiiN and Keithmcbrief as their new botlane. Whether this new lineup will receive the old team’s spot in the Expansion series automatically is still unknown.

The last team on our NA list is Denial eSports. An eventful month for the team, as they lost two of their players - Cackgod and Nubbypoohbear left for Enemy eSports - the former retaining his position as a toplaner, while the latter joining as a Coach. This leaves Denial with just AnDa, Stixxayy and SupportDaddy, and two large holes in their roster, with no information available yet as to which players they might pick up as their new midlaner and jungler.
