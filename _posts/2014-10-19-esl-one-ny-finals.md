## Some Post-Tournament Analysis of the Teams and the Meta

Big tournament LAN finals normally present the best opportunity to examine the pro scene: from the shape of the metagame to the current form and future potential of teams. The reason is quite simple – everybody’s bringing their A-game and nobody’s experimenting too hard, which means that the results are representative of what the current situation in competitive Dota 2 is.

That’s why we’ll attempt to make predictions about this Dota 2 season (by that we mean the period from TI4 to TI5) based on what happened a few days ago at ESL One New York. Sure, not all teams had a chance to fight at Madison Square Garden and half of the teams that went there played just one best of 3, which means that the data we’re using isn’t exactly rich. Nevertheless, we feel that the quality of the data is high and we can make some good general conclusions about what’s to come in the future.

## THE METAGAME

The word that describes best the tournament is **diversity**. We got to see some clever 4 protect 1 strategies alongside super aggressive early/mid game pushing and ganking strats. The longest games in the tournament lasted more than 70 minutes, while the shortest less than 20. This is great news not only for the viewers but for pro teams as well: it is obvious that in the current patch diverse strategies are viable. This gives a lot of freedom to the teams to experiment, find what they are comfortable at and play what they like rather than stick to a certain set of heroes and one dominant play style.

There was a very fine (and satisfying) balance between old proven-to-work strategies and new (or forgotten) ideas. Just as 1.82 came out many people were saying that the aggressive pushing metagame is about to die and teams are going to go back to late game drafts centered around super hard carries. This proved not to be the case.

Indeed, at ESL we did see some very convincing performances by Anti-Mages and Terror Blades in nail-biting 60+ minute games. Players like Loda and Black showcased the power of calculated defensive play in combination with split-pushing. 

Nevertheless, the most first phase banned heroes were once again Death Prophet and Razor, which tells us that teams still respect the early/mid game strength of the two heroes and most importantly – their pushing power. Moreover, Panda was arguably the central pick/ban in the tournament. It got picked up 13 times (out of 18 games!) out of which the hero won 8 games. Bear in mind that Brewmaster is definitely not a super late game pick – the hero’s power is in controlling early and mid game fights. This tells us that despite the higher comeback potential in 1.82 teams still value very highly such qualities. 

## VICI GAMING

If we are going to talk about which teams look promising we need to start from the winners of the event. VG didn’t simply win some games of Dota, they showcased amazing strategy, tactics and execution, especially at day two of the tournament.

The most impressive thing about the team is how well they could execute totally different play styles. Some games Black would play hard farmers like Anti-Mage or Terror Blade and others he would play active utility heroes like Brewmaster or Invoker. VG are showing levels of versatility that strongly remind us of the TI4 DK squad or the TI3 Orange E-sports team.

In this patch, as we already commented, different strategies seem to be viable. Being able to play the whole spectrum is undeniably a great advantage because you are able to adjust your picks based on your opponent’s draft rather than stick to what you know and get counter-picked. In the same time playing completely different strategies on a consistently high level is probably one of the most difficult things to be able to do in Dota. So far VG seem to have this ability, and if they are able to stay consistent (without internal conflict, etc.) they could very well prove to be the No.1 team of this season.

## Alliance

It is hard to judge a team after one best of three series, however, this particular series displayed in Alliance something we haven’t seen for a while. Let’s be honest – the TI4 meta of aggressive 5-man pushing didn’t really fit the team famous for being the best rats in the world. 1.82, however, seems to be different. 4 protect 1 is becoming viable again and Loda seems to be very comfortable in picking up some super hard carries.

Of course, the team didn’t win the series and didn’t advance in the tournament, but bearing in mind that they were competing with a stand-in the way they played is still very impressive. Because of this we believe that if Alliance manage to find stability (permanent substitutes of EGM and S4 that fit in well with the rest team), they could surprise many people and get back to being one of the very top Dota squads in the world.

## SECRET

(In day two it turned out what comes around goes around.)

Team Secret is probably the team that left us with the most mixed feelings from the bunch.

On the first day they had the most convincing win so far in the tournament over Na’Vi US. Sure, the American Na’Vi squad isn’t the hardest competition in the world right now, but the way Secret disposed of them was a very clear statement that they are one of the best in the world. Their game plans were very solid and the execution was top notch. The team seemed to have good momentum and people expected a lot from them (the betting odds for Secret VS VG were heavily in favor of Secret).

In day two, however, the EU team appeared entirely out of their comfort zone. Not only were the drafts questionable but they got severely outplayed by VG.

Because of this we feel that the future of Secret is very hard to predict. On one hand, the team certainly holds great promise and they have displayed their potential. On the other, it is quite possible that after a few heavy losses (like the one against VG) there would be a clash of egos and the players inside would stop ticking together. This is the curse of all-star squads in all sports. If Secret are able to overcome this through friendship, professionalism or leadership, would determine if they will be able to become one of the top teams on the scene.

It is interesting to speculate who will become the top dog in Dota, but regardless what happens it seems like the viewers are up for a treat in the upcoming year. The diversity and overall quality of the games of ESL holds a promise for the near future and if Valve, event organizers and teams manage to overcome the incredibly annoying technical issues that plague the scene nowadays it is possible that the upcoming year will be the most entertaining so far.
