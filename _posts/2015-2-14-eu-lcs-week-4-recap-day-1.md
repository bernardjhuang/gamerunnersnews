## Battle at the Bottom of the Standings

Coming into the first match of the week, Gambit find themselves at a place they weren’t expecting after their performance at IEM Cologne. The team came into the season with high hopes and looked to improve on their abysmal results in the previous split. With momentum from their win against H2K and Giants inability to find success on picks outside of Jax, this game was a perfect chance for Gambit to secure a victory. However Giants weren’t going to roll over and give an easy win by starting of strong 3 buffing Gambit. Unfortunately as new teams constantly show, lane swaps are something they have yet to master. Although Gambit were able to cement an early lead on the back of P1noy’s Kalista, weak vision control gave Giants a few kills and even a Baron as they ramped into their late game comp. Even with their strong late game comp, Giants were unable to come back from the four uncontested Dragons Gambit took throughout the game. All Gambit had to do was secure the final Dragon and push for the win. Finally with the help of the 5th Dragon buff and a Baron Gambit cleaned up after a sloppy game from both sides. 

## Passive Play Costs a Victory

Week 4 looked hard enough for H2K, with matches against Elements and ROCCAT, on top of that add a roster change replacing support Voidle with kaSing the team hoped to show improvement on last week’s 0-2 result. What would normally be a strong bottom lane in Graves and Janna proved to be Elements undoing when a late arrival to the lane allowed H2K to take Kruggs and get an early level 2. Thanks to the experience advantage, H2K’s bottom lane poked out their opposite numbers and an out of place Nyph gave Hjarnan an early first blood.  H2K used their lead in the bot lane to take objects around the map without allowing Elements to ever come out ahead.  Although Elements showed small signs of life in the mid lane repeatedly ganking Ryu they could only trade kills. Once behind, Elements defaulted to their normal passive playstyle hoping to scale up and beat them in the late game, unfortunately their comp didn’t scale well and too many uncontested Dragons and better map play from H2K never gave Elements the chance. The passive playstyle couldn’t bring Elements back in the game as their star AD Carry ended the game 0/0/1. It’s too early to say whether H2K’s decisive shot calling is a result of their roster change, but they closed the game like some of the best veteran teams. 

## Tower Dive a Rumble They Said… It will be Fun They Said

MYM hoped to block out the drama surrounding them and put up a fight against the strong Fnatic lineup. Their hopes were quickly dashed as a greedy and late tower dive on a level 3 Rumble gave a double kill over to Huni and sealed MYM’s fate. The combination of a strong Rumble, paired with a Corki and Xerath gave Fnatic a strong mid game siege and the ability to push down towers that only a perfect engage and team fight from MYM could stop. Although a few fights at the end of the game didn’t go as cleanly as Fnatic would hope, MYM was behind from the beginning and it was Fnatic’s game to lose. 

## Love Conquers All

ROCCAT boasted the hardest schedule in the first few weeks of the LCS, but they were finally able to pick up a few wins and looked to become the top team everyone says they could be. ROCCAT has been strong in scrims and many still believe they are a top team, but they haven’t transitioned these results to the LCS stage. ROCCAT’s early game has been a cause for concern and the Unicorns punished this and pick up 1v1 and 2v2 kills to put them ahead in the early game. With their kills and the control Kikis’ Nidalee had in the jungle, Unicorns pushed their advantage throughout the map. 6k gold behind at 20 minutes gave Unicorns of Love firm control of the driver’s seat. The pushing power from Dragon and Baron was enough to secure a 30 minute victory. 

## The Streak Continues 

So far no one has been able to stop SK and loosen their hold on first place. Thanks to Airwaks’ Nidalee the Copenhagen Wolves bot lane was able to get the better of nRated and Forgiven and looked to win the game from the bot lane. Unfortunately as many of the SK players have stated before this is a team game and SK had firm control in top and mid lane. A 12 minute fight proved exactly why nRated keeps going back to this Lulu pick. The Wolves tried to go aggressive and kill Forgiven but a Wild Growth saved him and allowed SK to reengage with the Rengar ult and Freddy’s timely teleport. As the Wolves desperately attempted to disengage they ran right into Fox’s LeBlanc who was able to pick up Soren’s Ahri on the way down to the fight. Lissandra’s teleports have always been strong and add a 20 cs difference on top of that SK picked up an easy Ace. Once SK get a lead they rarely lose it and their map play is on par with none and with a little help from Copenhagen Wolves’ questionable item choices, SK take control around the map. 7 and 0 the streak remains unbroken.
