Hi. I'm Sammy, an enthusiast of League of Legends since launch (and of moba since Defense of the Ancients). Among my many years of playing Leagues and moba, I've noticed many hidden elements of this game. In this article, I will shed some light on tricks and tactics employed by many top tier players that can help dramatically increase your gameplay mechanics. 

[Previously in this article series](http://news.gamerunners.gg/lol/top-summoners-1/), we examined Animation Delay Canceling, which involves timing ones auto attack with Moving and Positioning or Casting. We learnt about the three phases of Auto Attack:

* 1) Our Champion charges up to Auto Attack.

* 2) Our Champion attacks.

* 3) Our Champion stands still. 

Phase number 3 is the Animation Delay, which is about half the duration of our Attack time spent.. doing nothing..! To be more productive, we explored options of moving or casting during the the Animation Delay phase to enhance our mechanics. In this article, we will be looking at more advanced aspects of Animation Delay Canceling - We'll look at Spell Animation Canceling via other Spells, Flash, and Movement.We'll also be looking at Crescent from Tiamat/Ravenous Hydra and seeing how we can cancel its animation to create a burst.  Let's start by looking at Tiamat/Ravenous Hydra's active - Crescent.

## Animation Delay Cancel: Canceling a Spell Animation With Another Spell

Many spells in the game have an Animation Delay just like AA (Auto Attack). For Spells that do have an Animation Delay, it can often be cancelled with another spell.

An example is that Wukong can cancel his Crushing Blow with Nimbus Strike:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Dus7Qc7Jj0w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The first segment of the video shows Wukong casting his regular combo: Nimbus Strike -> Crushing Blow. The second segment of the video shows Wukong canceling his Crushing Blow's Spell Animation by following up with a Nimbus Strike. Since Crushing Blow cannot cancel Nimbus Strike's Spell Animation, the second segment of the video (where Animation was cancelled) was executed quickler and almost simultaneously!

There is a lot of vagueness surrounding whether a spell can cancel the Animation of another spell. The best thing is to just play around with our Champions. We should try all various casting combination and see what can cancel Animation and what cannot. Riven is known for being able to cancel all her spell animations with specific spell combos. FragonHD made a great video on Spell Animation Canceling for Riven:

## Animation Delay Cancel: Canceling a Spell with Flash

Another way to cancel Spell Animation is with Flash. For example, in this video, I use Dragon Kick and Flash:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/G-IAWL2Y0NM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Notice that I cast Dragon Kick first. Dragon Kick charges up; however, I use Flash immediately to teleport Lee Sin behind the enemy to Dragon Kick Zed in the rear end! 

Since Lee Sin kick activates from behind Zed, I kick Zed towards my teammates for the kill. This is an effect that should be observed. Flash will redirect the effect of charge-up Spells to a new location. This can be useful! Imagine a Vayne Condemning the enemy and Flashing to Cancel Animation and redirect towards a wall for the stun. Hi Im Gosu pulls this off successfully for a Triple Kill!

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/tsih-Zsl4w0?start=324" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

What we see in common with Dragon Kick and Condemn is that they have a Charge-Up time, so  we can imagine that many Champions with a Charge-Up time for Spell Casting can abuse an Animation Cancellation combo with Flash. But there are many other spells that do not have a Charge-Up time that can take advantage as well, so just experiment around with your favorite Champion and see what interesting effects you might find.

## Animation Delay Cancel: Canceling a Spell with Movement

Some Spells can be cancelled with Movement. Riven is a prime example. Take a look at Boxbox demonstrating Riven's "Fast Combo:"

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0qO715z_OKk?start=3" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Boxbox's second combo, the Fast Combo, landed just as many Auto Attacks, but in shorter amount of time. How is this possible? 

What is happening is that Broken Wing's Spell Animation is cancelled via Movement. After Broken Wing's Spell Animation is cancelled, Boxbox uses an AA (Auto Attack) immediately. AA too has an Animation Delay, but it is cancelled via Broken Wing. 

Basically, the combo = (AA->Broken Wing->Move). This process is repeated 3 times. 

I do warn that if you do try this, this is EXTREMELY difficult to pull off. It requires amazing timing and takes hours just to even pull it off correctly once. So do not be discouraged if you cannot do what Boxbox does on your first tries. Practice makes perfect!

And again, not all Spell Animations can be cancelled with Movement. Experiment around and maybe you'll discover that your favorite Champion can have a "Fast Combo" as well!

## Animation Delay Cancel: Ravenous Hydra - Cast With Spell for Burst

*(image from leagueoflegend.wikia.com)*

While I see many people utilizing Crescent to cancel AA Animation Delay, Crescent is most useful Active for adding extra burst damage to our Spells. Crescent is similar to a Spell like Lee Sin's Dragon Kick since it has a Charge-Up time. During this Charge-Up time, we can activate a Spell, and the Spell will be casted almost simultaneously. FragonHD demonstrated this in his/her video, but just about any Burst Champion can take advantage of this. Take for example, Wukong:

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9HyA2OZSND4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this video, I combine 3 forms of Animation Canceling - AA Animation Cancelling, Spell Animation Canceling, and Crescent Animation Canceling:

* First, I use an AA to begin with.

* Second, I cancel the AA's Animation Delay with Tiamat's Crescent. 

* Third, I cancel Tiamat's Crescent's Animation during Charge-Up phase with Crushing Blow.

* Fourth, I cancel Crushing Blow's Spell Animation with Nimbus Strike.

The result is a very quick and strong burst.

**I find it helpful to place Tiamat or Ravenous Hydra in item slot #1 so that I can click 1 to activate it. It's much easier than finding 3 or 5 on the keyboard!

## Conclusion

Spells can be cancelled in three different ways - via:

* 1) Another Spell

* 2) Flash

* 3) Movement

However, not all Spell Animation can be cancelled. 

We also saw that Tiamat's/Ravenous Hydra's active - Crescent is similar to a Spell; therefore, it can be cancelledin the same way. However, Crescent is best cancelled by casting a Spell because it adds a small but damage-worthy burst damage to our Spells. 

With these in mind, try experimenting around in-game and see if your Champion can use one of these methods of Animation Canceling to breathe life to possible dormant comboes!
