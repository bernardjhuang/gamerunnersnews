### How old are you?
20.

### Are you going to college? or considering college? 
I went to college for a semester in applied sciences but I just couldn't focus on studying because I was thinking about League of Legends all the time. Maybe later, I'll go back and finish my studies.

### Do you do this full time?
Yeah, at the moment. 

### Do you currently live in a gaming house?
I'm at home and living in a student flat.

### A lot of people these days want to go pro in League of Legends - how did you get involved with RCTIC?
I found a few teammates in soloQ and we wanted to get to get sponsorship and help the Finnish eSports scene. So, my teammates and I reached out to different sponsors. I didn't know anyone before we made the team, I just found all my teammates from soloQ. 

### Has being pro affected your game? 
It's more stressful now - I have a different mindset. Now, I want to constantly get better at the game.

### How were you guys able to take the LanTrek 2014 tournament?
We practiced a lot of rank 5s and SoloQ and we kinda knew we were the best team. We actually didn't lose a single game there. It was my first LAN event that I won. 

### What is the team doing to improve your opportunities into LCS and what does practice consist of?
First, we need to get into the challenger series. Of course you can practice like 10 hours a day, but doesn't help if you don't learn from the games that you play. We constantly like to analyze the games we play and see where we can improve.

### What is the management doing?
We have had some [LoL boot camps](https://www.facebook.com/RCTIC/photos/a.10153941391177837.1073741833.155295642836/10153941391412837/?type=3&permPage=1) so we can talk face to face. And we get sponsored gear, so they are helping quite a lot.

### What are LoL boot camps?
We get 5 computers in the same place and play a lot of LoL and analyze our game. It helps to see your teammates there. They don't get as angry with you when you criticize them. 

### How long do you practice every day individually and with your team?
At least 4 hours - but a normal day would be like almost 7 hours of SoloQ. Team practice is about 3 hours and including DuoQ's with teammates. As ADC main, DuoQ'ing with support its kinda like ranked 5s. 

### What has it been like to be able to maintain your current roster for 1.5 years? 
It's changed. Some players had to go to the military service and college and other obligations. Some players just didn't work well together with some other teammates. 

### About in-game shot calling: Is it instinctive, reactive, or are you planning events minutes before you do them?
Reactive - As an experienced player, so I can react to situations easier.

### Does RCTIC currently have a team coach?
Yes, we do.

### How important do think coaching is for the team or individual?
It's been a MASSIVE improvement when we have a coach to talk about the game with. He's able to give us a different perspective and it helps with the egos. 

## WRAP UP

### What are your goals in the next 2 years? 
Get to the Challenger Series and who's knows maybe LCS.

### What about 5 years?
I probably want to be involved in eSports in some way. But I don't plan that far ahead. I kinda just go with the flow.
