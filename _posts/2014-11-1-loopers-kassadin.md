Previous to his re-work in March of 2014, **Kassadin** was a mid-lane permaban for his ridiculously high mobility, solid laning and late-game scalling in just about every competitive scene on the planet. 

Since his rework, Kassadin hasn’t really found a true home – while some players such as Fnatic’s **xPeke** continued to try him out in the mid-lane, with mixed results, Kassadin all but fell of the map as a top tier pick into the second half of 2014. Without the silence on his Null Sphere Kassadin was simply viewed as too inconsistent or risky a pick for the competitive level.

However, one player has continued to pick Kassadin and has made it work – Samsung White’s top-laner, Jang **“Looper”** Hyeong-seok. 

So what makes Kassadin a fit for the top lane, and how does Looper use the Voidwalker to the maximum potential? 

Let’s find out!

## Why Kassadin? Picks and Bans

Before we jump into some games, I think it’s important to understand the situational nature of a top-lane Kassadin pick and what to look for when considering picking Kassadin in your own matches. 

Looper <u>doesn’t</u> pick Kassadin every game, and with good reason: he has a lot of direct counters and when playing from behind can be highly ineffective. Furthermore, he requires a lot of time and farm to become truly powerful and his early game is extremely vulnerable (especially pre-6). That being said if the situation is right Kassadin has the potential to completely take over a game if picked and played correctly.

Let’s start by looking at a few pick and ban phases from the **2014 World Championship** and examine what cues Samsung White looks for before even hitting the Rift when considering Looper his Kassadin.

First we have **Game 3 between Samsung Blue and Samsung White** in the semi-finals. Here, White chooses Kassadin for Looper as their fourth pick (second round) after Blue picked up an early Ryze for Acorn. Dating back to the OGN Spring and Summer season, Kassadin has been one of Looper’s top choices when facing off against the lane-bully Ryze. I’ll go more into detail about the Kassadin versus Ryze matchup down below, but for not suffice it to say that Looper favours the matchup enough to pick it consistently despite the many strengths of Ryze.

![Kass pick 1 SSB vs SSW LCS - lol pro analysis](/images/content/kass-pick-1.png)

That being said, simply picking Kassadin into Ryze is not necessarily always the correct choice – Looper and White are too smart to allow their choice of top-lane Kassadin to become a liability. *They understand the limitations of the champions and craft their strategy around it.*

To complement and off-set the late-game scaling and early weakness of Kassadin, White choses a roster full of **early and mid game utility, mobility and damage**. **Lee Sin** and **Fizz** put a lot of ganking and roaming pressure on the map even very early on into the game while **Twitch** provides a healthy dose of pick and assassination potential heading into the mid-game. Rounding out the roster, **Janna** helps the team disengage from unfavourable fights but also gives Twitch and Fizz the extra protection needed to safely dish out damage. 

Essentially, White carefully crafts their roster around the Kassadin – they have a very good four man squad capable of taking fights, making plays and getting out alive, giving Looper the time and the space he needs to become a late-game threat. Especially when looking at Blue’s roster and seeing the incredibly strong skirmish and ganking potential of **Rengar**, **Twisted Fate**, and **Lucian**, it was crucial that White respond with champions that could still fight early without their fifth member. On the flip side, Looper gives White’s more mid-game focused lineup the extra late-game power to deal with threats like Ryze if the game stretches late. 

Another interesting pick-ban phase to examine is Game 4 in the Grand Finals of the 2014 Worlds between Star Horn Royal Club and Samsung White. 

![SHR vs SSW Kassdin - pro lol analysis](/images/content/kass-pick-2.png)

Once again we have a Kassadin picked later in the draft once Star Horn Royal Club has guaranteed the Ryze will be sent top. Even if the Ryze went mid, the Lulu versus Kassadin matchup is similar in a lot of ways to the Ryze versus Kassadin, and so Looper feels confident enough to pick the Voidwalker in either top lane scenario. 

Also, look at how While has once again crafted a team with characteristic similar to their draft against Blue: **strong skirmish champions, high burst and solid protection and disengage**. Here DanDy’s **Rengar** provides the assassination potential that Twitch did in the other draft while **Corki** gives the four man squad excellent poke, burst damage and waveclear should they need it. Lastly, **Orianna** and **Janna** are both very safe champions with high offensive and defensive potential leading into the mid-game.

To reiterate, White once again knows that they need a strong four man squad with a lot of utility and damage in order to give Looper the space and time he needs to deal with the Ryze. In both of these matches White presents a very balanced team composition which uses Kassadin’s strengths to the maximum and covers up his weaknesses – allowing Looper to use his laning prowess and stability to hold of Ryze and scale up while the rest of the team isn’t hurt too badly by his lack of presence in the early game. 

These are the sorts of situations and game scenarios which must be considered when planning on picking a top-lane Kassadin.

## Understanding the Strat: Kassadin vs. Ryze

So now that we have a better idea of what to consider when drafting a top lane Kassadin and the sort of team composition necessary to support him, let’s take a closer look at the thought process behind why Kassadin is an effective counter-measure against the extremely popular mage-bruiser Ryze.

### 1) Similar Items Paths and Power Spikes

While Kassadin is not nearly the lane bully that Ryze is, both champions have extremely similar power curves and gain noticeable advantages off certain item thresholds, notably **Rod of Ages**. There are few top-lane champions with the kind of late game scaling and consistently high magic damage that Ryze offers to a team, but Kassadin is one of them. The theory here is that with all things being equal, the Kassadin’s higher mobility and chase potential matches what Ryze brings to the table and works well to offset the inherent strengths of the Rogue Mage. Kassadin can match Ryze’s power at just about all stages of the game (except for the very early laning phase) which gives teams a lot more freedom when considering their late-game options.

### 2) Global Pressure and Ganking

One thing that Kassadin offers that Ryze simply cannot is mobility and gank potential across the map. While they both run Teleport Kassadin has the significant advantage of being able to move across the map much faster than his counterpart and respond to ganks or invades in a much timelier fashion. While Ryze is scary when he is off the map for the catch potential his Rune Prison offers, Kassadin is an outright terror and can take over a map with his Riftwalk and burst. Once again having an assassin in the top lane opens up teams to many more options when picking, banning and playing.

### 3) The Balance Effect of Teleport and Safe Laning

So as mentioned, Ryze is quite the lane bully – anyone who’s played against a good Ryze knows the harass potential he offers, especially against a melee champion like Kassadin. However, this does not mean that the lane is a sure win for Ryze. Quite the contrary, if played patiently and safely Kassadin has a really good chance of exiting the laning phase either even or only slightly behind. This is due to the fact that the current meta in the top lane almost always favors the choice of the Summoner Spell Teleport, and without Ignite or significant gank pressure the kill potential Ryze has against a Kassadin is extremely low. Unless there is a major misstep by the Kassadin player, Ryze should never earn a solo kill onto Kass: the damage is simply not there with Teleport when Kassadin’s high mobility and spell shield are taken into account. 

This leads to a mildly annoying but still effective laning phase for Kassadin, which is crucial to finding success later in the game.

## Game Analysis: Samsung White versus Star Horn Royal Club (Game 4)

Now we have a clear idea of the ***when*** and the ***why*** of playing Kassadin in the top lane: let’s consider the how. 

An excellent game to look at is Game 4 between Star Horn Royal Club and Samsung White since Looper does a lot of small things right to make his Kassadin as effective as possible.

Let’s jump into the replay:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GTx2HL02-dU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

While there is certainly a lot to look at here in terms of the overall decision making of White and the play of the other members, I wanted to focus specifically on Looper and some of the decisions he makes throughout the game that really work out in his favor.

### The Early Game: Playing at a Disadvantage

The early game starts out rather quiet for Looper, with a lane-swap placing him in the bottom lane rather than the top. He plays the early game slowly, taking farm where he can against Cola’s Ryze – sadly at around the 4:30 mark of the match he gets ganked by inSec and the Rune Prison ensures he goes down as first blood. 

If he was playing defensively before, this guarantees that Looper will be on the defensive foot for at least the next few minutes: not only is Cola up a chunk of experience but Looper no longer has his Flash to escape another potential gank. 

![SSW vs SHR Kass gank 1](/images/content/kass-gank-one.png)

Notice how Looper ***never*** looks to trade against Cola for the next little while – he understands that even with his spell shield and passive magic damage reduction the early Tear onto Cola is simply too great of an advantage to deal with. He takes last hits where he can and uses his abilities to their maximum potential to last hit at a distance or under tower. He only crosses the river if he KNOWS where inSec is and even then he never pushes up to the tower. 

Around 11 minutes, Looper finally makes his move: he Teleports to the mid-lane to turn around a gank onto PawN. Cola had just teleported a few minutes earlier, meaning that Looper had the advantage in terms of cooldowns and he punished Star Horn Royal Club for their aggression. Even pre-Rod of Ages, Looper uses Kassadin’s mobility to net himself a much needed Double Kill. 

![SSW vs SHR Kass tp 1](/images/content/kass-tp-one.png)

This is the exact mentality you need to take when playing Kassadin: ***safe, but opportunistic***. Looper recognizes the cooldown disparity between himself and Cola, assesses the fight and joins when he knows victory is assures. He makes no risks in lane because he understands that Cola’s early lead negates any possible aggression; however, he can exploit vulnerabilities across the map to recover from his poor start.

With the pair of kills, Looper successfully equalizes the lane between himself and Cola and nets a Rod of Ages at 13 minutes, an excellent timing.

Thanks to his patient play and understanding of the various strengths and weaknesses of the enemy team not only in his own lane but across the map, Looper is able to totally make up for his early death and earn himself what every Kassadin needs: an early snowball.

### The Mid-Game: Pushing it Forward

Heading into the mid-game and throughout the rest of the match, there are two lessons to learn from Looper’s play.

First, it is how to abuse power and cooldown differences. It is crucial to note that Looper abuses the power disparity between him and Cola. Look at their inventories **around 13 or 14 minutes**: Looper has his RoA ready and stacking while Cola is still sitting on components. Looper punishes Cola for not having a completed item by forcing an engage at Dragon: he walks down to join his team and fight near the objective. Even when the fight breaks out at around 15 minutes, Cola has only recently picked up his RoA while Looper has had it for several minutes. The health and damage disparity are noticeable as Looper jumps onto Cola near the Dragon pit and takes him down with the help from his team.

![Looper's Kassadin jumping on Cola](/images/content/kass-jumping-on-cola.png)
 
Due to the fact that the Kassadin-Ryze matchup is *very close* even at the best of times, taking advantage of each and every minor advantage possible is critical to getting ahead and staying ahead of the Ryze – and as Looper shows us, **the timing difference in terms of the two RoA’s is the first major one**. I’ll go into more depth about this difference in power later in the article, but for now it’s safe to say that coordinating your power spike with your team to force fights is an excellent idea when playing top lane Kassadin. 

Throughout the rest of the fight at Dragon and the rest of the game, Kassadin’s chase and control potential kicks in, as he is able to constantly hunt down fleeing enemies and deliver massive slows in an AoE with Force Pulse. This massive turnaround from his early struggles are all thanks to the slow, patient recovery and explosive mid-game that Looper delivers, all the while keeping in mind the power spikes of his champion relative to Cola.

The second major lesson to take away from the rest of this match is **mana management**: unlike pre-rework Kassadin, this new iteration of the champion is very mana intensive. The scaling mana cost of your ultimate might seem like no big deal, but thanks to the nerfed 40 second stack duration multiple Riftwalks in a row can quickly leave you desperately OOM – never a good position to be in, doubly so on Kassadin.

Watching Looper, you’ll see how **patient and calculated he is with his Riftwalks**. He always keeps his mana in check and Riftwalks only when necessary, and rarely any more. A good rule of thumb to follow is two or three Riftwalks in a fight, which will put you up into the 1200 mana per Riftwalk territory, which is the upper limit for a mid-game Kassadin. 

Watch the Dragon fight, and count how many times Looper Riftwalks: in a fight where he is involved in just about all five kills, he only Riftwalks *three times*. He even uses his Flash instead of another Riftwalk in order to gurantee he has the mana and cooldowns necessary to finish the fight.

Smart mana management and thoughtful use of your ultimate can make or break a good Kassadin. Nothing is worse than jumping into a fight and realizing you can’t Riftwalk out because of lack of mana – play smart and you’ll find Kassadin a much more rewarding champion to play. 

## By the Numbers

### Items

An all regen start is not uncommon for Looper, especially when playing against ranged champions or those with free harass against a melee Kassadin such as **Ryze** or even **Rumble**. **Crystalline Flask** along with a few **Health** and **Mana Potions** should provide all the health and mana you need to get you to your first recall. 

Rushing **Catalyst the Protector** as part of a fast **Rod of Ages** is key on Kassadin as the goal is to get to the Rod as fast as possible – I consider an 11 or 12 minute RoA to be the ideal timing to any mage, and Kassadin is no exception. Rod of Ages offers just about everything you could ask for: bonus mana to support your Riftwalks, health to dive into skirmishes and come out alive and of course ability power for added damage.

And now we come to the question of Kassadin: ***Tear Versus No Tear?***

One of the common misconceptions about Kassadin is that he NEEDS **Tear of the Goddess** to be effective – one look at Looper’s build shows us how flawed this assumption can be. Looper never builds Tear on his top-lane Kassadin, instead favoring a rushed Rod of Ages into secondary items. 

Why is this? 

It’s all about timing - unlike Ryze, Kassadin does not scale very well off of mana, making the Tear of the Goddess significantly less effective for Kassadin than it is for Ryze. This means that you need to invest in the full ***Archangel’s Staff, and extra 2000 gold,*** to earn the full benefit of the item. Simply put, Kassadin cannot afford to have such a delay in his power, especially against a Ryze who gains a lot of benefit even from the naked Tear.

On the other hand, *not going Tear* also gives Kassadin a significant edge in terms of the power offered by **Rod of Ages** – whereas Ryze needs to stop on the way to buy a Tear (700 gold), Kassadin has no need for the item and can rush his RoA without delay. This often leads to a ***4 or 5 minute period of time where Kassadin has his RoA and Ryze does not***, offering a significant window to capitalize on the power difference. 

It is crucial to undetstand this timing window and take full advantage if you want to make the Kassadin versus Ryze matchup work.

Instead of a Tear/Archangel’s, Looper almost always goes **Zhonia’s Hourglass** second for the offensive power and defensive potential. The ability to go immune is perfect to allow Riftwalk’s cooldown to come back up when in a tight jam.

Boots are **Sorcerer’s Shoes** for the added Magic Penetration but **Mercury Treads** are good against very high disable lineups or if you feel like the extra Magic Resistance is necessary.

Luxury items for Kassadin include **Void Staff**, **Rabadon’s Deathcap**, **Abyssal Scepter**, and **Morellonomicon** depending on how the game is going and the enemy team composition. 

### Skill Build

Starting with a point in **Null Sphere** (Q) is a great option for last hitting at a distance while also giving you the spell shield necessary to survive trades against Ryze. At level two, Looper takes a point in **Nether Blade** (W) for increased last-hitting power and mana recovery.

While **Force Pulse** (E) is the final skill that Looper levels, he still maxes it by level nine because both the damage and the slow scale incredibly well while being very mana efficient. At 90%, the slow is one of the largest in the game and can help Kassadins and his teammates chase down fleeing enemies or catch out multiple memebers in a teamfight. Maxing Null Sphere second gives Kassadin maximum burst when combined with a highly leveled Force Pulse.

Obviously **Riftwalk** (R) is taken at the standard 6, 11, and 16.

### Runes

*Source: LoL Match History*

In most games, including those at Worlds, Looper goes for a highly scaling rune page with a splash of early-game power. For the most part however Looper focuses on Kassadin’s period of strength, the late game, with a good mix of offense and defense.

Starting out with **Ability Power Quints** gives Kassadin that early game punch to trade in lane, but the rest of the page is geared towards maximum late-game damage and surviviability with **Ability Power Per Level Blues**, **Magic Penetration Reds** and **Armor Per Level Yellows**.

The complete omission of Magic Resistance might seem odd at first glance, especially when considering Looper often picks Kassadin into Ryze or occasionally Rumble. But when you take into account Kassadin’s passive, which reduces all magic damage by 15%, as well as the spell shield on his Null Sphere, the absence of MR Runes makes a lot more sense. Kassadin shouldn’t need the extra defensive stats for dealing with mages, but the armor helps him mitigate the damage from auto-attack harass in lane while also allowing him to jump onto the enemy AD carry in the late game.

That being said you could substitute the AP scaling runes in favor of extra armor of magic resistance depending on matchups or if you feel like a more defensive build is necessary.

### Masteries
 
![Worlds Looper's Kassadin Masteries](/images/content/kass-masteries.png)

*Source: Probuilds.net*

Looper’s Kassadin Masteries are pretty standard for an offensive assassin type mage with **21 Offense – 9 Defense**. Cooldown reduction, increased magic penetration and damage are all benefits of going deep into the Offence tree. Like on any other assassin **Dangerous Game** is a must to sustain through skirmishes while the added damage from **Arcane Blade** is perfect for Kassadin to last hit in lane and hit extra hard with his Nether Blade. **Feast** is also excellent for helping Kassadin stay alive in lane and move past his weak period.

As a melee champion, the Defense choices should come as no surprise: reduced auto-attack damage from **Block**, increased health and bonus regeneration from **Veteran Scars** and **Juggernaut** all help Kassadin deal with pesky ranged opponents when going in for last hits. 

Overall this setups helps Kassadin a lot when laning against Ryze in particular and should allow you to scale well into the late game while also keeping you safe in the early stages.

## Lessons to Learn

There are a lot of things to take away from Looper’s Kassadin. Here are a few:

* **Team Comps**: Playing top-lane Kassadin into Ryze is not a sure fire win. Consult with your team and ensure that they understand the weaknesses of Kassadin and play their picks and play accordingly. This strategy is not a one man show: it’s a concentrated team effort.


* **Timing Windows and Power Spikes**: Recognize the item disparity between yourself and Ryze, especially with the Rod of Ages, and punish the enemy team for it. At the same time, known your limitations and power spikes and adjust your play to work around your weaknesses and harness your strengths. This also means taking advantage of cooldowns on Summoners, especially Teleport. If you have the TP advantage, use it.

* **Don’t Despair**: If you get ganked, if you fall behind, keep your cool. Kassadin has a lot of potential, but you can’t force it. Kassadin require a level head and smart decision making to be effective – farm your way back into the game if necessary and rely on your team to carry you past your infancy (don’t worry, you’ll repay the favor later in the game)

* **Mana Management** – Don’t be the Kassadin who dies to a gank because he can’t afford that crucial Riftwalk. Ultimate only when necessary and keep a careful eye on your stacks – it’s almost always better to wait that extra five second for the mana cost to reset. Patience pays off in making sure you can deliver consistent damage for the duration of a fight.

I hope this look into Looper’s Kassadin was helpful. Maybe next time you see a Ryze in top you’ll think about Voidwalking up there like one of the world’s best.
