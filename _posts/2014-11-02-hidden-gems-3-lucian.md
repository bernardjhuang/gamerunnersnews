Lucian is unique AD carry that relies heavily on bursting damaging spells to deal high damage. In addition to strong damage-dealing spells, Lucian has one of the strongest passives in the game - Lightslinger:

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting](/images/content/hg-lightslinger.png)

Lightslinger gives a bonus to Lucian's Auto Attack after casting a spell. Because the bonus damage is so high, this passive completely defines how Lucian's will play. That is, Lucian's will have a pattern of Cast -> Attack -> Repeat. This pattern of attacking optimizes Lucian's damage which is unrivaled Early Game among other AD Carries. 

However, because of the pattern of casting and attacking, half of the time, Lucian is casting. Since most Spells do not benefit from Crit. Rate, Lucian's damage is not optimized with the standard AD Carry build. Lucian needs a new unique build that matches his unique playstyle. Just think of how creative AD Carry builds can get because of unique playstyles, such as the Blue Ezreal Build or the Magic Penetration Corki. Lucian, who has probably the most unique playstyle of all, is going to need a new build. That is, he needs to reinvest money that is usually spent for Crit. Rate elsewhere. Where you ask? The answer is Armor Penetration. Let's take a look at The Culling to see why.

## The Culling

The Culling is an amazing ultimate capable of immense damage. Let's take a look at the base damage of The Culling at level 3, Maximum Total Damage...

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, the culling](/images/content/hg-the-culling.jpg)

*(image from leagueoflegend.wikia.com)*

Well, maybe it's not over 9000!!! But 1980 is IMPRESSIVE. However, as impressive as The Culling may be, people build Lucian impairs The Culling into just an average Ultimate. Many people build items that focus on Lucian's AA (Auto Attack), such as Statikk Shiv or Infinity Edge. However, there is a better way! 

The Culling benefits from AD, Attack Speed, and Armor Penetration (and AP... I suppose). However, if we look at the AD ratio for The Culling, it is a measely 25%. Therefore, if we are to optimize The Culling's damage, we musn't fall for the AD trap! 

The Culling Benefits much more from Attack Speed and Armor Penetration. Therefore, our perfect item to achieve this is Youmu's Ghostblade. 

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, youmu's ghostblade](/images/content/hg-youmu.png)

*(image from leagueoflegend.wikia.com)*

Youmu's Ghostblade provides AD, Armor Penetration, and Attack Speed, all of which will benefit The Culling. For this reason, Youmu's Ghostblade is a standard item in Lucian's item pool. However, we cannot stack Youmu's Ghostblade, so what do we build after? Attack Speed items are generally associated with Crit Rate stats (such as Phantom Dancer or Statikk Shiv); however, Crit Rate doesn't do any justice for The Culling. Building heavy AD items won't help much either with The Culling's 20% AD ratio. Our option left is Armor Penetration. Armor Penetration provides, of course, Armor Penetration, and AD, both of which benefit The Culling. These 2 stats are also going to be the stat that will perfect our Auto Attack and Spell Casting pattern-of-attack-damage ratio.

## Lucian vs. Lucian 

Me and my friend got together to test out if my Armor Penetration Lucian could beat a more orthodox standard build. This is the result:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/rHOv6s0jE-A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I won the fights without Infinity Edge which many praise as the greatest of ADC items. However, I did replace my defensive item with an Infinity Edge in the second fight to see if I'd still win. I did. For a build that is so much cheaper, I am doing much more than the standard build. Of course, this does not come without a drawback! In the last fight, we demonstrated that my build has a weaker Auto Attack than the standard build. However, because Lucian is a Caster-Type AD Carry, it isn't about maximizing our Auto Attack damage; Rather, we should be in search of the perfect balance between Spell Damage and Auto Attack damage. Armor Penetration bridges these two gaps. 

## The Set-Up

Let's take a look at our Rune Page.

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, lucian rune page](/images/content/hg-lucian-rune.jpg)

This Rune Page provides 19 Flat Armor Penetration to optimize our Spell Damage. However, our AA won't be doing as much damage. Therefore, last hitting will be much more difficult Early Game. This set-up also completely avoids Life Steal. However, if you feel the need for Life Steal or more AD for last hitting, feel free to adjust. Customization! 

I also have some Health and Armor runes. Generally, if you are the aggressive-type, Health is better to survive in a long-commited fight. However, Armor is better for sustaining as it mathematically improves the value of Health that will be provided to use via Life Steal or Health Potions. 

And we can't forget Masteries:

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, masteries](/images/content/hg-lucian-masteries.jpg)

This is rather a standard AD Carry Mastery Page - 21-9. Some may wonder what I did not invest in Warlord, which gives a +5% bonus AD. Actually, Warlord is in general, a terrible Mastery to get. Some think Warlord provides the +5% bonus to total AD. But this is not the case. Say for example we have 100 innate AD, and have 100 AD from items. We would only get a measely 5 bonus AD our Mid Game. Early Game is even worse. The +7 AD from Doran's Blade will only become +7.35 AD. Boo! 

I also did not get Frenzy for the same reason. Frenzy is orientated towards Late Game, but Lucian is extremely strong Early. Therefore, I invest in points that would benefit Lucian Early to snowball early on. If there is anything we should learn from Samsung White, aggressive Early Game plays win hard!

## Core Items

In the order of importance (left to right), here are Lucian's core items.

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, core items](/images/content/hg-lucian-core-items.jpg)

*(generated at leaguecraft.com)*

I know 5 core items sound ridiculous. Since we are stacking Armor Penetration, the 4 Armor Penetration are core. However, Blade of the Ruined King is, hands down, the most mathematical cost efficient damage item in the game. In any 1 vs 1 fight between AD Carries, the one that first has Blade of the Ruined King will win. Just watch any pro games, and it is obvious that Blade of the Ruined King (and Youmu's Ghostblade) are rushed items in the new AD Carry meta for an Early Game Power Spike. It also provides us with Life Steal to sustain Early Game.  Therefore, with Blade of the Ruined and stacked Armor Penetration... we have 5 core items. 

Including the Armor Penetration via Masteries, Rune Page, and items, we reach 59 Flat Armor Penetration, 25% Armor Reduction (The Black Cleaver), and 39% Armor Penetration (Last Whisper and Devastating Strikes). With all this, we can do True Damage to a 125 Armor Target.

This item build has mad synergy: 

* Blade of the Ruined King's passive and active are both augmented by all the Armor Penetration (approximately 30% of damage dealt to Champion will come from Blade of the Ruined King!)
* Not only does the AD provided by all the items help, but the Armor Penetration and the Attack Speed boost from Youmu's Ghostblade and Blade of the Ruined King optimize The Culling to its fullst.
* We gain a 30% Cooldown Reduction boost from all the Armor Penetration items. This synergizes so well with Lucian's spammable spells.
* Kite like madness with Relentless Pursuit:

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, relentless pursuit](/images/content/hg-relentless-pursuit.jpg)

*(image from leagueoflegend.wikia.com)*

Relentless Pursuits will be on such a short Cooldown with all the Cooldown Reduction coming from our Armor Penetration items. The addition of Youmu's Ghostblade and Blade of the Ruined King's active also give us a speed boost that makes Lucian an untouchable god.

* Lucian's Light Slinger and The Culling stacks The Black Cleaver almost instantaneously.

The build is strong Early, Mid, and Late game! Youmu's Ghostblade and Blade of the Ruined King gives a strong Early Game Power Spike. Stacking Armor Penetration after that only makes things better, faster, and stronger.

## Optional Slots

Once we have enough money, we can leave our boots or The Brutalizer behind to adapt:

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, ](/images/content/hg-mercurial-scimitar.jpg)

*(image from leagueoflegend.wikia.com)*

If we find ourselves being assassinated by Zed, we can buy Mercurial Scimitar. Because Zed's Deathmark counts as a debuff, the Quicksilver active can remove it. Mercurial Scimitar also provides us a boost to our offense as well. Because Mercurial Scimitar is very expensive and very situational as well, buy this item only if appropriate to the situation!

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, ](/images/content/hg-infinity-edge.jpg)

*(image from leagueoflegend.wikia.com)*

If we want more DPS, buy an Infinity Edge to total to 50% Crit Rate and 250% Crit Strike Damage. I personally don't like Infinity Edge because it's extremely cost efficient, and the boost to Crit Strike Damage is only a 25% increase in DPS (2.5/2.0=1.25). Youmu's Ghostblade mathematically gives more DPS when the active is up. Only buy Infinity Edge if we have an extreme excess of gold and if there are no Assassins.

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, ](/images/content/hg-trinity-force.png)

*(image from leagueoflegend.wikia.com)*

Trinity Force Late Game won't boost our DPS by that much, but it's just a good item to have Late Game because it packs a lot of stats for one item. There is synergy with our Armor Penetration build however! The bonus damage via Spellblade will be augmented with Armor Penetration since it counts as Physical Damage. Purchase Trinity Force Late Game only because it is cost-inefficient. If we want a full damage build, consider both Trinity Force and Infinity Edge as our 2 optional items to melt even tanks!

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, ](/images/content/hg-guardian-angel.png)

*(image from leagueoflegend.wikia.com)*

Knowing that our Lucian will ressurect upon Death, Guardian Angel is a great way to dissuade the enemy team from focusing fire on our Lucian. It also provides the lack of Armor our build has to reach a balanced stat build defensively and offensively. However, Guardian Angel isn't so useful when it's Unique Passive is on Cooldown. Therefore, sell Guardian Angel for another optional item after death if possible. 

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, ](/images/content/hg-randuins-omen.png)

*(image from leagueoflegend.wikia.com)*

Randuin's Omen is a great item for kiting Physical -Damaging Champions. The active slows nearby enemies allowing us to create distance. Randuin's Omen also provides a good Health and Armor boost. Only buy Randuin's Omen if there is or are Physical Damagers trying to dunk our Lucian!

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, ](/images/content/hg-banshees-veil.jpg)

*(image from leagueoflegend.wikia.com)*

Banshee's Veil is hailed as being the greatest defensive item for AD carries. While I do not personally like it, Banshee's Veil is a great item for preventing enemy Crowd Control. Buy this item especially if there are AP Assassin Champion's on a bounty hunt for Lucian. Champions, such as AP Amumu and Le Blanc will find it a million times more difficult to Assassinate our innocent Lucian because of the Magic Resist boost, Health boost, and Spell Block. I firmly believe that just better positioning can solve these problems however. But if getting in the thicks of fight is your playstyle, Banshee's Veil may be for you.

![Lucian best build armor penetration - lol theorycrafting, ](/images/content/hg-frozen-mallet.png)

*(image from leagueoflegend.wikia.com)*

This is another item to help us survive against burst damage with its hefty +700 Health boost. But it also has a nice Unique Passive - Icy. Icy will slow our enemy target helping us to kite more effectively and to chase our opponents with greater ease for the Pentakill. Icy is especially effective because it is a 40% slow. 40% slow is much more effective than a 40% boost to speed mathematically. Thus, Frozen Mallet can even help us replace our need for Boots.

## Conclusion

Because Armor Penetration is generally more associated with Caster-Type Champions, AD Carries which focuses primarily on optimizing AA damage, usually are not compatible with the Armor Penetration stat. However, with the introduction of Lucian, whom has a hybrid source of damage between AA and Spells, we must give a second though before we give Lucian a standard AD Carry build (ones that focuses on AA). To adapt to Lucian's unique playstyle of mixing AA with Spells, we ought to adapt a unique attitude towards Lucian as well. Our new attitude comes arise in the form of a shift from the orthodox AA-orientated Rune Page and Item build. We begin to look into Armor Penetration as a solution to gapping AA and Spell Damage. Armor Penetration, which offers an optimum average damage between AA and Spell-casting, becomes our new best friend.
