It’s not a secret that a good performance in the lane control phase will result in, at least, a very decent team-fighting phase. I’m sure you know each lane is different. Maybe top and bot are geometrically similar, but the best way to play each isn’t the same.

In this article, we will going to decode the bottom lane. I’m going to give you the basis and the tools to improve the way you play and give you the confidence of taking the right choices. Let’s go for it.

## SOME CLARIFICATIONS

Unless you’re extremely curious, you’re reading this because you want to play as a support or an AD Carry. In this article, I won’t delve in any of these roles in particular. Why? Cause the lane is for both of you. Position and mobility is a subject that both of you should know and apply perfectly.
Of course, there are situations where the behavior of each will be different, in that case, I´ll make the necessary clarifications.

## RECOGNIZING THE FIELD: POSITIONING

![position of each lane + jungle](/images/content/beat-bot-lane.jpg)

In the image above, you can see the position of each lane and the jungle. Also the zone each team controls at the start of the game. Now, the first thing you must know as a bot lane master is how far away you can go before being in danger.

*(Left: Blue team - Right: Purple/Red team)*

As you can appreciate in the image above, the zone of control is different for each team. Because of the dragon and the jungle construction, the blue team zone of control is a little smaller. Forget what everyone says in the forums, the way you play differs completely depending on what side of the river you are. However, the position principles remain.

This principles says that, unless you have some kind of advantage, like a dead enemy jungler or fighting under your tower, always stay behind of your minions (especially if you´re ADC or a ranged support), stay in your own zone of control until you´re sure that the enemy tower is or will be down.

I’m deliberately forgetting the wards, cause it’s not relevant for this topic. However, we are assuming that you and your partner have already done that. If you don't, you must.

About the differences between blue and red in the bottom lane, usually blue has the necessity of pushing the lane; because their zone of control is smaller, they need space to have mobility. Recommended for red team is, either make sure the blue minions stay close to their turret but not enough to be killed, so they can gank easily and focuses on farming, or be rocks and push the lane as far as they can, establishing control and pressure over the enemy. 

## MOBILITY: TO PUSH OR NOT TO PUSH

![lol pushing lanes](/images/content/beat-bot-lane-3.jpg)

The answer is… depends. Mostly, you don’t want to do it.

Pushing the lane, something that many regular players (but surprisingly, not all of them) know, is extremely dangerous. It is because, at first, you´re extremely vulnerable to gank. You’re fighting in **their** zone of control. That means that the turret can hit you and enemies can easily win the kill. Worst, probably your partner will try to help you, reinforcing the opponents with a double kill.

The trick here’s that pushing the lane has important advantages. Your minions are fighting under enemy tower, so farming will be much more difficult for your opponent. In addition, when you push the lane, you can invade the enemy jungle while your opponents are distracted, stealing monsters from their jungler.

Finally, you’re in a better position, being able to help in the middle lane, ward the dragon, go back for the red monsters and, probably the most important, now you have a bigger zone of control and your enemies has limited mobility. 

Pushing, usually, is better when you´re sure that the tower will fall, you can kill someone or you´re playing a champion with some sort of escape ability, the case of Caitlyn, Leona or Vayne. 
Another situation arises when you’re sure that their jungler is prepared to gank. If you can coordinate a very fast enter – damage – escape combo you can do it as a bait in order to kill him with your own jungler’s help. 

There are many ways in which pushing the lane can be a very profitable tactic. However, it always depend of the current situation, your partner abilities and your enemies.

## AGAIN, SOME CLARIFICATIONS

Sometimes, pushing the lane isn’t an option. If you’re playing Tristana the lane will practically push itself. In that case, the best you can do is last hitting as much as possible and then let your minions fight under the enemy turret. Go back to your safe zone. Once they’re defeated just wait for the new wave and repeat the process. The reason you do this is because you don´t want to be further. Tristana, in particular, needs a constant last hitting to be effective in the mid game, when she isn’t very good and become a monster in the late game.

You want to maintain your minions under your enemy’s turret, where they have troubles to farm, and then contain the new wave of minions in the middle of the lane, where last hitting will be very easy.

Once you’re strong it’s easy to destroy the turrets and finish the lane control phase.

If you’re a support, don’t be selfish, really, even if your ADC isn’t very good. You can become, eventually, useful in the late game, when team battles are decisive. Your AD Carry, instead, can´t do anything without farm and kills. Literally, nothing. Your work is probably the most important in early game. Put some wards, support your ADC, help the middle lane when possible, try to steal the enemy’s monsters when your partner push the lane and, for the love of the flying spaghetti monster, be the one who start the fights.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT POSITION AND MOBILITY

All of these tips are basics, elementary knowledge to become a very good ADC or Sup. That’s because you can understand your environment, your allies and your enemies. The first step to win a match is finishing the lane control phase with the best possible performance. After that, things can become good or bad, without that, everything will be wrong. Terribly wrong. 

Learn to control your champion. I know it sounds obvious, but mostly of people (including myself) doesn’t know all the possibilities each champion possesses. Each ability can open a range of applications, combos and stat improvement. Don’t waste your time trying to solve a puzzle with the wrong pieces. Study your champion, find someone who can teach you, watch the best players and fall in love of your character. This web, Game Runners, is one of these ways to become a better player, learning from the bests.

Once you do this, once you learn how and when your favorite champion can work properly, once he/she is an open book for you, amazing things will happen.

Be innovative. I’m not the greatest expert in League of Legends. I’m still learning where to position myself and how to move correctly. If you have an idea, then go for it, you can always start another game.

Before leaving, let me give you a final advice, probably the most valuable to improve position and mobility.

## THE FINAL TIP: DON’T BE AFRAID TO “RALLG”

Position and mobility are important for one, and only one reason. You don’t want to die. Maybe you have scored 30, 50 or 60 kills, or only two kills and ten assistances. You can be in lvl 8 while your team partners are in lvl 18. It doesn’t matter. Only if you don’t die. If you do, then you’re reinforcing your enemies and betraying your team.

Sounds horrible, I know, but it’s the truth. Of course, you maybe will die in the middle of a team-fight or you’re not capable to fight four opponents. However, never, **ever** die for nothing.

A free kill is inacceptable.

RALLG (I’m still working in the acronym) is the top one advice I can give you to improve the way you play, especially in bottom lane.

When you’re facing your death, when your death is nothing but useless, just RALLG (Run away like a little girl).
