Samsung White’s mid laner PawN is thought by many to be the best Jayce player in the whole world, and what he showed us in the first game of the World Championship Finals only serves to feed that thought even more. Finishing the game not only as victor but with a perfect score and largest killing spree as well, PawN is the one I give credits to for the huge influx of mid lane Jayces that I have been witnessing in nine out of ten games in solo queue after the Worlds final. In this analysis we are going to delve into the playstyle he utilized for the first game of Worlds. Let’s start off with his rune and mastery pages setup, as well as summoner spells, ability order and core build.

### RUNES

![SSW PawN's Godlike Jayce Runes](/images/content/ssw-pawn-godlike-jayce-runes.jpg)

Since PawN was up against Corn’s Orianna he has taken flat Magic Resist glyphs for reducing any poke damage. The reason he did not opt for flat Health Seals and went for Health per level instead is because he was not looking for lane dominance against Orianna. PawN knows that Jayce is a very, very safe laner, being able to farm from range, boost his movement speed with Acceleration Gate and disengage in Hammer Stance with Thundering Blow. But he also knows that Orianna is a much safer laner, if not one of the safest, with her shield and a slow/MS boost field, combined with her Shockwave’s crowd control. Thus he understands that he’s in for a passive lane and takes runes which scale better into the late-game. 
A passive lane also allows him to pick up flat Attack Speed quints which scale very good with Jayce in all stages of the game, providing him with a faster attack animation early and an extra Muramana proc in-between Hyper Charges late-game. He still packs flat Attack Damage marks since AD is still the stat which Jayce scales the best with, also making last-hitting easier. 

### MASTERIES

![SSW PawN's Godlike Jayce Masteries](/images/content/ssw-pawn-godlike-jayce-masteries.jpg)

A standard mastery page for offensive AD Caster champions, only choosing to sacrifice points in the defense tree for more sustain from the utility tree, to make his stay in a passive poke lane longer and easier. It must be noted however, why he picks Spell Weaving. It is probably one of the best masteries on Jayce, because it requires 3 basic attacks for your next spell to deal 3% more damage, and Jayce’s Hyper Charge gives him maximum AS for his next 3 attacks. This means that he can stack the mastery very quickly and then shoot off his powered Shock Blast for even more devastating damage than it already has. Keep in mind that 3% more damage might not seem like much early-game, but late-game when the numbers get bigger it starts to matter a lot.

### SUMMONER SPELLS

Going Flash and Exhaust speaks passive farm/poke lane louder than his rune page setup and utility masteries. But his choice of summoner spells allows for Mata to run Ignite on his Thresh while still having an anti-assassin tool in the team. And that alone is huge, because SHR do not have Exhaust to stop Imp from blowing people with his Twitch, while SSW can use it to stop Insec’s Kha’Zix and his reset mechanics, as well as, potentially, a hypercarrying Ryze or Tristana. Also, with a versatile support such as Thresh running Ignite and a high-damage carry like Twitch versus a very defensive lane, (Tristana’s weak early-game coupled with Janna’s peel) it provides SSW’s bot lane with the option to make aggressive maneuvers.

### ABILITY ORDER

This is PawN’s skilling order on Jayce from this game. It is the standard ability order for Jayce.

### CORE BUILD

PawN’s core build for Jayce is Muramana, Brutalizer, Last Whisper. He starts the game with a Long Sword + 3 potions and aims to get a Tear of the Goddess on his first back to start stacking for Muramana. His next item is Brutalizer for CDR and Armor Penetration, after which he picks the Manamune up and starts building Last Whisper. Usually, he does NOT buy boots until he gets his 3 core items, as he doesn’t really need them until then. 

## IN-GAME DECISIONS 

### EARLY-GAME

From the very start of the game we have PawN making plays as he uses his Q in Hammer Stance to slow Zero’s Janna which sets Zero up for Mata’s hook, after which PawN attempts to cause as much damage as he can before flashing away and letting his team secure first blood on Zero. 

The gold he receives from the assist allows him to buy 2 additional potions. With a Long Sword and 5 potions, combined with his runes and masteries, PawN can out-sustain and out-push Orianna. Once he notices Orianna’s mana pool is low, he lets Dandy know that they can dive Corn. With the enemy mid laner being low on mana, PawN having Exhaust and Dandy playing Jarvan, they are able to chain-CC him under tower for a flawlessly coordinated dive tanked by PawN, who survives because of his well-picked sustain masteries and receiving almost 0 damage from Corn due to the chain-CC. Dangerous Game’s heal plus Culinary Master’s instant health gain from using a potion ensures his well-played survival of the last tower shot.

On his next back he already has a Tear of the Goddess ready to stack as well as another long sword, a vision ward, sight wards and a switch to Red trinket, making SSW’s vision control even better. This lets him push Corn as much as he wishes to. After poking and pushing him, he takes a leisurely stroll up top lane to help his team dive and shut down a potential hyper-carry in the image of SHR Cola’s Ryze by firing an accelerated Shock Blast which takes a huge chunk of Cola’s health, grants PawN an assist and ensures a fast, no casualties dive. At that moment Orianna teleports to the top lane turret and then PawN shines once again, immediately reacting with Hammer Stance Q + E for burst and CC, chaining it with Exhaust to reduce Corn’s follow-up burst damage, all while tanking the turret since Looper’s Maokai was low on health, after which he flashes away from another perfectly executed dive with a 2 kills advantage for his team. 

### MID-GAME

Once PawN has finished his first 2 core items, Manamune and the Brutalizer, as well as grabbing a pickaxe, he roams bottom lane just as SSW’s bot lane is being ganked by Insec’s Kha’Zix. A Flash and hook by Mata with the damage from Imp leaves Insec at almost half HP, but PawN is already in range. He shoots the Q first and then uses Gate for an instant accelerated Shock Blast, killing Insec from about 45% health with precise aim, continuing to snowball himself and his team.

20 minutes into the game, the huge early lead has snowballed so hard that SSW claims an inhibitor. At this point, PawN has finished his core build of Manamune, Brutalizer and Last Whisper, with the Manamune evolved into Muramana. His E + Q poke damage is demoralizing for SHR. On his next back he gets Ionian boots of Lucidity and a B.F. Sword, after which Black Cleaver, but the game has pretty much ended by then. And it does, after SSW’s last assault on SHR’s base. A single knockup by Dandy on SHR Uzi sets him up for a Shock Blast for his whole HP bar, pretty much ending the game right there. Which is why I will not be writing about late-game, but I will offer a couple of notes instead.

## NOTES

In this first game of the World Finals, PawN and SSW as a whole portray what it truly means to be a great League player. A deep understanding of mechanics is only a fraction of what is needed to be on this level. A great knowledge of the game is also not enough. Both of these are required and must be combined with great decision-making skills and coordination to form a great player such as PawN. You can see all of this at work in almost every play in this game, especially the flawless dives. 

To the readers: I hope that you have enjoyed this read and used it as a way to enhance yourselves as players. Remember that there is always something new to learn in a MOBA where every game is different from the previous one.
