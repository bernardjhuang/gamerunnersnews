Hi. I'm Sammy, an enthusiast of League of Legends since launch (and of moba since Defense of the Ancients). Among my many years of playing Leagues and moba, I've noticed many hidden elements of this game. In this article, I will shed some light on tricks and tactics employed by many top tier players that can help dramatically increase your gameplay mechanics. 

In this article, we will be taking a look at Animation Delay Canceling. Animation Delay Canceling involves timing ones auto attack with Moving and Positioning or Casting. Because Animation Delay Canceling is an advanced skill, do not expect to be a master of it overnight. But do not despair! Anybody can do it. And in this article, we'll be taking it slow and easy. We'll be examing Animation Delay Canceling in small simple bits. By understanding each slice of the pie that makes up Animation Delay Canceling, we too can be masters of Animation Delay Canceling and play like a pro! So without further ado, let's get started.

## The Three Phases of Auto Attack

What most people understand about Auto Attack is that its speed is determined by our Champion's Attack Speed. However, what many do not realize is that about half of the Attack Speed is just delay.

When we right click an opposing target, our Champion will begin to Auto Attack. When our Champions begins to attack, three things will happen:

1) Our Champion charges up to Auto Attack.

2) Our Champion attacks.

3) Our Champion stands still. This is the Animation Delay! 

## Animation Delay

During the Animation Delay phase of Auto Attack, we cannot Auto Attack again until Animation Delay ends. However, while we may not be able to Auto Attack during the Animation Delay phase, there are still two things we can do:

-Move and Position

-Cast

So what does this mean? Since our Champion is just standing still during the Animation Delay Phase, it's much more productive for our Champion to either be moving or casting while waiting for the Animation Delay to end. This requires a lot of timing. If done properly, we can replace the third phase of Auto Attack with Moving/Casting without affecting our Attack Speed at all. 

Technically, we would be Moving/Casting and Auto Attacking at the same time!

So what does Animation Delay Canceling look like?

In the above video, after I attack, I move Miss Fortune during Phase 3 of Animation Delay. I then re-attack; however, Miss Fortune still experiences Animation Delay because Phase 3 has not ended yet. Therefore, we need to space out our Auto Attacks more to maximize Animation Delay Cancel.

This time, I space out Miss Fortune attacks, and notice that Miss Fortune experiences no Animation Delay after attacking. Not only that, notice that Miss Fortune covered a LOT of ground during the Animation Delay phase. 

## Cancel Animation Delay Via Moving

By moving to cancel Animation Delay, we gain advantages:

1) We can position ourselves better. This is EXTREMELY important for AD Carries as positioning is argueably the most important factor for AD Carries. If we are squishy but have lots of damage, we want to be in the perfect position to optimize damage output while avoiding damage. Repositioning on the third phase of Auto Attack will help us consistently adjust our positioning to maximize our potential as a carry.

2) We can kite (run while hitting) without losing any Attack Speed and damage output. For example, if an Assassin is chasing us, we can move backwards or sideways during the third phase of Auto Attack, and then shoot back. This allows us to avoid being hit at no cost. 

Here's a good example of some kiting by Hi Im Gosu:

3) We can dodge skillshots. CLG Doublelift often weaves left and right during the third phase of his Auto Attack to maximize dodging against spells:

4) We can chase better. If we were to just right click our opposing target, our Champion would freeze during the third phase of Auto Attack. Therefore, we want to manually click our Champion to move forward until the Animation Delay phase ends, and continue hitting.

Here, I manually had Varus cancel Animation Delay to chase. By doing so, I was able to keep nearly in melee range. However, towards the end, I stopped canceling Animation Delay. Notice how far Soraka got when I stopped manually chasing!

## Cancel Animation Delay Via Casting

I would like to point out some points regarding casting.

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dIgHQc2XGx0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Here, I have Varus Auto Attack, then I cast, and Auto Attack again. However, compare this to the video below:

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WGES27T-c60" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This time, I start by casting and then Auto Attacking. Notice that in the second video, I suffered no Animation Delay after casting. However, in the first video, after I cast, I experience a short delay before being able to Auto Attack. This means that casting doesn't necessarily completely cancel out Phase 3 of Animation Delay; rather, casting is just something more productive to do during Phase 3 of Animation Delay. 

Also, some spells come with Animation Delay. Wukong's Crushing Blow is treated as a normal Auto Attack; therefore, we experience delay:

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9FhY14tjT-k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

However, Wukong's Nimbus Strike has no delay. Notice how almost instantaneous the second hit went off:

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8u2AYaOWVOU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Try experimenting with your favorite Champion. Check to see if there are any Spells with delays.  If so, it is best to save a Spell to cast during the delay. If not, think about how Auto Attacks should be mixed with Spells to optimize damage. There's a lot of planning needed! 

## Conclusion

Animation Delay Canceling is most relevant for AD Carries since Animation Delay Canceling is all about exploiting Auto Attack, which AD Carries build for. This is why AD Carries are usually known for having incredible mechanics. However, Animation Delay Cancel is still relevant to all Champions (just not as much for Casters).

We can think of Animation Delay Canceling like this. Since we are using the other half of Auto Attacking to do something more productive than just standing still, a player who has mastered canceling Phase 3 is using only Phase 1 and 2 to attack (which is half of the whole process). If half the process of attack is taken out, we are essentially attacking TWICE as fast, and simply using the other half to position or cast. However, Animation Delay Canceling is particularly difficult because the duration of Phase 3 consistently changes as the game progresses, and our Champions gain more Attack Speed via items or innately. Not only do we have to keep adjusting, but when we hit a high level of Attack Speed, we have to be clicking REALLY FAST to keep up with how small Animation Delay has become. This takes a lot of practice. If we accidentally cancel the charge up phase of Auto Attack, then we've just lowered our Damage output. So be careful! This isn't something that can be mastered overnight. My last tip that I can give to you is to just practice. Practice makes perfect!
