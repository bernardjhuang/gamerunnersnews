Expected to be one of the last patches before the new pre-season patches, 4.19 will sadly not be followed up by the comically requested “Blaze it” patch players yearned for. Nonetheless, with a bit under a week since being released, the patch brought few but interesting changes, mostly to champions above all else.

## Miscellaneous changes

Patch 4.19 was the last patch which held the bulk of the files for the upcoming Summoner’s Rift revamp. After a hefty period of testing in the PBE servers, players will soon be able to test out the new Rift, which will be available at an as of yet unmentioned future date. What is known is that it will first be available for Team Builder and all bot games, afterwards for normal and custom modes, and finally for Ranked. 

Besides the long-awaited ingame revamp of the beloved Rift map, the other miscellaneous changes are really as named - miscellaneous. When updating the patcher will have a sound effect for finished patching, the Launch button has also been audiolized, and a few non-descript alignment issues within the patcher have also been fixed. Besides these small changes, the ingame store will now load faster, specifically its Featured tab, and there have been some cosmetic changes to the pictures of a lot of non-champion items within the store, for clarity’s sake. 

Apart from the above, the only other changes are in the new-ish feature Suggested Players. As you may remember, the introduction of the feature in patch 4.14 gave you the option to have an easier and less time-consuming way of inviting people you’ve played with a lot or at least recently. After a derelict start, Riot has made a few small changes - from now on, players that you have honored will be heavily and more often as a whole featured in the list of Suggested Players, and the feature will promote players near your skill-level when suggesting your Friend’s friends. Besides the fact that the feature is a bit clunky, the new changes might prove productive, although I for one am interested whether the feature uses just my Ranked rating or more information when choosing friends of my friends for the list.

## Champions

For those of you who missed it, you can glance over at Singed’s new godly graphics and changes [at his official Riot page](http://gameinfo.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/singed/).

Besides the updated ability icons, splash and ingame textures, his E spell and ultimate are also getting some love this patch.  Up until now Singed’s Fling would also immobilize its targets after they land, but with the changed mechanics to the skill, targets will now fly longer and higher, but will be able to move immediately after landing. While this may be a negative change for some, most players have rejoiced over the further bugfixes to the ability, removing its inborn clunkiness which basically threw targets in whichever way it pleased. On top of that, if you fling a target into your W, they will now get snared for 1 second. All in all, good changes, albeit not changing that much.

His ultimate is also getting a kick in the positive direction. Up until now, it would give Singed 35, 50 or 65 Ability Power, Armor, Magic Resist, Movement Speed and Health/Mana per 5 seconds, depending on the level of the skill. Now it will give 80 instead of 65 at level 3, a flat bonus of 15 more stats all around which will definitely give him more power in the later stages of the game. 

![4.19 LoL patch Lucian](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Lucian_1.jpg)

The next big changes that were made concern Lucian. His W skill - Ardent Blaze, is getting both a nerf and a buff. Seeing as Lucian has been a prime-pick for quite some time now, damage is being pulled away from his W, as up until now it gained 30% of all of your AD as damage, but that ratio has been removed completely. To balance it out, the movement speed bonus which used to be a flat 40 across all levels will now be from 40 to 60 based on the level of the spell. The other big change that has been approved is the increase of cooldown time for his ultimate - The Culling at all levels. Up until now it was 100 at level 1, 75 at 2 and 50 at level 3. With the implemented changes, it will go from 110 to 100 and finally to 90. This change will level out some of the hard damage he dishes out at later phases of the game. 

Ryze, Janna and Zilean are the rest of champions with interesting changes at hand. Ryze’s main source of damage - Overload, his Q skill 40 to 120 damage based on level, down from 60 to 160. At level 1 he deals 20 less damage, which increases incrementally by 5 per level, until he deals 40 less damage when it is at level 5. As the spell is heavily relied upon for combinations, and is often spammed, these changes have for the moment affected although slightly how the champion is played and used. 

Janna has two small changes to her repertoire - her Howling Gale will always be used in the direction of your cursor, as a bug forced Janna to move into range up until now. The other small change is that her W - Zephyr, will now have a flat cooldown of 12 at all levels, compared to the old 12 to 8 seconds cooldown based on level. Effectively this will mean that using her W will make Janna a prime target for a longer period until her W is back up and its passive in play.

![4.19 LoL patch Zilean](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Zilean_0.jpg)

The last interesting changes affect Zilean. The Chronokeeper has finally met his fate, so to say, and his passive that granted +8% experience globally to all his teammates will now work in a range of 1500 only. While that will not dissuade people from playing him, it will lessen the brunt of unhappiness a lot of people have been proclaiming as he was one of the few champions left with a global passive.

While there are a lot of changes we have missed in our shortened version, most of the changes we have missed are bugfixes you can look through in [Riot’s official changelog](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-419-notes#patch-suggested-players). Happy hunting, Summoners.
