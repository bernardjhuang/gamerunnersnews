Season 4 has been dominated with **high mobility high damage junglers** such as Lee Sin, Pantheon and Kha’zix. They provided damage and the necessary early game power to force early ganks which would lead to snowballed victories. Following the season 5 jungle changes the **jungle has been greatly diversified** and increased the skill needed to jungle. The changes ensured that all junglers were somewhat viable and nerfed the potential of non-sustain junglers mentioned above. Although these changes spawned a new terror of soloque, Warwick, the **new items and smite allowed new junglers to arise**, occasionally trumping the might of the standard picks.

## What are Pocket Picks?

In order to analyze pocket picks, we must be on the same page on what that means. **Pocket picks are picks that are not expected to be picked in competitive play** due to either glaring weaknesses in the champion, or the ability to be shut down or taken advantage of by the collaborative play seen in competitive teams. Some champions may even become FOTM after being picked by a player, as the champion is viable but simply not noticed by other players. **This does not mean the pick is a troll pick or not viable in solo queue**. In fact champions like Amumu or Udyr which are seen to be decent picks in solo queue are not remotely viable in competitive play. This is because of weaknesses that can easily be exploited in their kit, such as easily being counter jungled and overly blue buff dependent in the case of Amumu, or the need of power farming and inability to gank being the aspect that breaks Udyr in competitive play. Pocket picks are used for a variety of reasons:

* They are almost never banned or contested in champion select.

* In a guide for Nocturne, ex-Fnatic Cyanide said "Who the fuck is experienced against a champion that nobody plays?” This is precisely the strength of a pocket pick, no one knows how to play against it, and this can be used to your advantage as you can pull off things no one else can.

* It can draw bans, after you play it. For example, Shook drew a Rammus ban at worlds against Najin White Shield after stomping with it, this freed up his main champion, Lee Sin and allowed Alliance to dominate that game.

However pocket picks have certain disadvantages:

* Champions are not in the Meta because they are not the strongest, by picking a pocket pick you may be giving up a champion that is strong and versatile in the current patch.

* It is hard to practice pocket picks since if pros use them in scrims or solo queue games often, it will be predicted and people will learn to play against it. 


## Kikis’s Twisted Fate Jungle

The first example of a pocket pick that I will be analyzing is Kikis’s Twisted Fate Jungle. During the IEM San Jose Tournament, Unicorns of Love faced off against Team Solo Mid in the quarter finals.  UOL managed pull off an upset win against TSM who are the winners of Season 4 NALCS. The game turned out to be a complete stomp in favor of UOL.

### About Twisted Fate Jungle

TF jungle is a high risk high reward jungler, when built on-hit he does a high about of DPS but is susceptible to burst. His play style is similar to that of an ADC, as he relies on positioning to be relevant in team fights.

### Picks and Bans

In terms of picks and bans, UOL won it heavily due to **the flex pocket pick of Twisted Fate**. Pantheon, who was clear to be TSM’s jungler was first picked, this allowed TSM to take highly contested picks of Gnar and Lucian. It is important to note that Pantheon’s **level 6 ganking power is quite high** with his ultimate, Grand Skyfall; Twisted Fate is taken into this as **he counters Pantheon’s pressure by having the ability to counter gank with his own ultimate**, this effectively nullifies Pantheon’s ability to force dives and ganks as TF can appear from anywhere on the map.

In TSM’s next rotation **they do not pick a mid laner**. Twisted fate is immediately taken along with Thresh, since Twisted Fate is **traditionally a mid laner** and is expected to be played as such, furthermore it is picked by **PowerOfEvil** who is the mid laner. However the suprising **TF** jungle pick allows him to **counter pick Xerath** with **Leblanc**, which in turn changes mid lane to a losing matchup for **Bjergsen**.

**UOL** has taken two very **snowball reliant sololaners** and the **constant ganking pressure from Twisted Fate** allows them to get on a roll early and begin stomping. TF is also a **flex pick as he can be built AP or AD**. In this game Kikis chooses to go with an **on-hit build** on TF it works well with the champion as well as the fact that **on-hit items are cheaper**, which is suitable for a jungler as you get less income than any of the solo lanes.

###Jungle Pathing

Kikis starts at his Gromp with a leash from top laner Gnar, he takes this camp without taking any damage, as they juggle the camp between them. Note that he smites Gromp as the on-hit build allows him to quickly stack the up the auto attack stun onto monsters. After that, as he takes red, Kikis is shown to be juggling the camp with the range benefit that Twisted Fate has. In an exclusive interview with Kikis, he said 

> “The most important thing in his (Twisted Fate) jungling is learning about how soft and hard resets work and use them to full potential. Also, since you are vulnerable to getting bursted, having good positioning.” 

In the new Jungle, the ability to kite the jungle mobs is a greatly valued asset and being ranged, it allows TF to take virtually no damage in the jungle. Kikis mentions that knowing the difference between hard and soft resets is what makes a good TF player, this means that you need to find the perfect range where the Jungle mob does not attack you but does not rapidly regain all of his HP back, by conserving HP this way it allows you to get a gank off on non-sustain junglers before you back.  In this clip the **Red Brambleback** is shown to be walking away and not attacking Kikis, it is important to note that it is not rapidly regaining HP. This perfect range allows him to get free DPS onto the camp.

### Early Gank
Due to this he is shown to be at full HP as he pulls of an early gank mid. Not many junglers especially a pocket pick that is unexpected is able to gank at level 2. As a result, there are no wards at mid and Santorin is not ready to counter gank. At this point, he has a level in his W and E. He primes his stun card for before enters the lane.

![Kiki's Twisted Fate Early Gank](/images/content/kikis-twisted-fate-early-gank.png)

He is immediately spotted by Xerath, but Kikis flashes in to the get stun. Leblanc has one of the highest burst potentials of any mid laner at level two. She takes a point in E instead of the usual Q in order to follow up Kikis’s CC with her own. Bjergsen loses 60% of his health in the combo and ignite. Kikis walks forward during the chain of CC, as he attack moves to keep in front of Xerath, in case if Bjergsen flashes  Kikis will still be in range for further DPS. After the stun ends, he auto attacks as in order to apply the red buff slow, this in combination with the slow and root of LeBlanc ensures there is no escape for Bjerg. This play sets up the LB snowball and PowerOfEvil is shown to get multiple solokills of Bjerg due to the early advantage. 

After the gank he clears bot side of his jungle without the need to burn his second pot, as he takes little damage from the camp. 

### Using Ultimate to Gank

![Kiki's Twisted Fate Ultimate to Gank](/images/content/kikis-twisted-fate-ultimate-gank.png)

Twisted Fate is a massive counter due to the fact that he can counter gank Pantheon but Pantheon cannot counter him back if played correctly. Here the vision that is provided by Destiny reveals that Pantheon is at the bottom side of map and cannot possibly be there in time to counter gank. This allows Kikis to get an easy gank off Dyrus which turns into a dive, without fear of retribution. Kikis uses attack move click the instant he arrives, this means that when Dyrus flashes over the wall, the already primed gold card will follow him through. After Dyrus is stunned and still within vision, Vizicsacsi can follow over with his own flash and execute a safe tower dive. 


## Statistics

## Runes

![Kiki's Twisted Fate Runes](/images/content/kikis-twisted-fate-runes.png)

These are the runes that he ran against TSM; he takes **scaling cooldown reduction blues** as he does not buy a single CDR item for the duration of the game and in the late game, the ability to dish out constant stuns with Wild Card is highly valued. He takes **attack speed marks and quints** as they allow him to clear jungle faster and lay on steady DPS as the camp resets, higher attack speed also allows for more procs of the Gift of Heavy Hands & red buff. **Armor runes** are standard and is a must take for most junglers. The armor that Kikis takes is much lower than the standard that most junglers should take as the new camps hurt a lot more, also it is important to note that it is **scaling armor** as he really does not need much armor due to juggling the camps. **The combined cost of these runes is 14145 RP**. Kikis says he will take **HP per level** if he wants to **rush Zhonyas**.

### Masteries

![Kiki's Twisted Fate Jungle Masteries](/images/content/kikis-twisted-fate-jungle-masteries.png)
 
In terms of masteries he runs the 21/9 set up, which is fairly standard. Note that he does not take attack speed masteries and favors 3 points into cooldown reduction instead. This is because he reaches a high amount of AS with items and runes, CDR is much more beneficial as when combined with his runes it will give him almost 20% CDR. He goes the AD route instead of the AP as it is more beneficial on an auto attack based TF. The rest of the masteries are fairly generic and expected.

### Ability Order

![Kiki's Twisted Fate Jungle Ability Order](/images/content/kikis-twisted-fate-jungle-ability-order.png)
 
Kikis starts off the game with a point on his EW when it is a standard start. If you are looking for an invade I recommend that you start W to CC and burst your opponents. He then takes a point in e and alternates leveling until both are maxed at level 12. He does not take a point in Q until necessary as it will do nothing when built on-hit.  He takes a point every time he can on ultimate.

### Items

Kikis starts the game with a Hunter’s Machete which is a must for all junglers. After performing a full clear he has enough gold for a Trailblazer and 2 daggers. This is because he needs to start stacking his Devourer as soon as possible, now that Trailblazer has been nerfed, consider taking Stalkers Blade as it helps with ganks. Kikis says “His (TF) build path might change” but is still viable after nerfs to Devourer and Trailblazer. As soon as he can afford Devourer he goes back and purchases it. Then he builds Wits end, with boots somewhere in the middle. Note he is **always buying wards** at this point and keeps up vision to get picks at the mid game. 

In his choice of boots he takes Mercury Treads which ensures he won’t get caught by CC. To further protect him, he buys Banshee’s Veil as his next item; this means he will be able to stay alive in fights to dish out constant DPS.  Although his build is not an AP one primarily he buys Zhonya’s as it protects him and it is essential when engaging with ultimate, as he can pull of the famous “Misaya Move”.

## Conclusion

TF and range junglers are strong pocket picks that are not expected, try your luck with it on Summoner’s Rift (just not in ranked)!
