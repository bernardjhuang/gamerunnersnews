Like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad, Elo hell is something exists within the confines of our mind, a feeling if you would, that has brought you to me. However, Chosen One, if by any chance that you came here by accident, go ahead and take this blue pill and the the story ends in, "...happily ever after." But, if you would like to continue your legend, Summoner, then I have prepared a special pill for you - the Red Pill. Once you take it, I'll reveal to you your true potential.

## "Elo Hell"

![LoL Elo Hell Matrix](/images/content/elo-hell.jpg)

*The matrix is a system Neo, that system is our enemy.*

Ever heard of the term, Elo Hell? I'm sure you have, and you probably know it as something as, "the inability to win due to teammates playing poorly." But isn't this quite the convenient definition? It's basically "external" factors other than you that are causing you to lose. To make it blunt, it's the mindset of pointing fingers and blaming others for our loss. But why do we do this? What's the source? It's a good question. Let's take a step down the rabbit-hole.

New Summoners are always searching for an answer to sustain themselves in the harsh world of League of Legends. These New Summoners then find themselves mimicing the strategies of others they encounter in their games. This creates something we call the "meta." But, let me tell you. The meta is not something to copy/paste into our system. I have 2 reasons:

* If we are in Elo Hell, and we copy the strategies of other people whom are in Elo Hell, are we going to improve? Think about it. Their in Elo Hell for a reason. If we copy their strategy, most likely, we will be in Elo Hell as well! 

* We shouldn't mimic LCS Summoners either! LCS is almost a completely different game in comparison to solo queue. This difference stems from the difference in communication level and team-synergy we have in-game. For example, LCS games often sends 2-3 people into the Jungle early game to counter the enemy team who does the same. In a normal solo queue, this strategy will probably cause doom as a team sending 2-3 people into the Jungle will cause us to be massively underfarmed and underleveled. Also, LCS Summoners build items accordingly to their team. However, in solo queue, we can't always depend on our AD Carry since he/she might might not know how to AD Carry and get assassinated instantaneously. Therefore, as opposed to LCS games, building around our team is not the best idea either. 

## The Tendrils of Meta

So why do people follow the meta? Well, the meta is an armrest for the New Summoners. However, as comforting as it may be, it suppresses curiosity, and invites ignorance. For more skilled Summoners, this can be the obstacle between being confined in Elo Hell and being at our god-like potential. 

Additionally, from my experience, a Summoner will be a called a troll if he/she does not follow the meta. So how I see it is, basically, the meta is a self-reinforced system that tries to preserve its existence. It does this through a parasitic method of infesting the minds of Summoners. From there, it  weeds out other Summoners, possible viruses that oppose its conduct.  For example, in a game where a team loses, a Summoner will most likely click "tab" to see who has the weirdest build to point fingers. Even if this Summoner isn't the cause of why they lost, he/she will be blamed just for being different! That's purely a negative stereotype attitude that we should not adopt for it does us no good. And we should definitely not be submitting ourselves to the reigns of the meta!

We basically have 2 options. The first is to be a slave of the meta, of which then we are shackled and binded of our freedom to forever wander in Elo Hell. The second is to question the meta and to look for holes, weaknesses in this fabricated matrix.

## Master 1 Lane & 2 Champions at Most

The meta tells us to master many different roles. It says that this is important to being successful in solo queue, especially because we can't always get our role. However, I let's raise our curiosity flag.

LCS Summoners can afford to spend 10+ hours practicing League of Legends; yet, the majority of the pros only play in 1 lane. They also tend to have a small champion pool. Obviously, because they are a pre-made team, they can have set roles. But there are other reasons for this.

"Mechanics" broadly means how well we play. In terms of Champions, one of the most important mechanic is knowing how to cancel Animation Delay. For those who aren't sure what Animation Delay Canceling is, check out [the secrets of top tier summoners](http://news.gamerunners.gg/lol/top-summoners-1/) and [the secrets of top tier summoners - continued](http://news.gamerunners.gg/lol/top-summoners-2/). 

Mastering a Champion is important because every Champion has a different base Attack Speed. Therefore, every Champion has a different timing for Animation Delay Cancelling. Of course, if we are truly cancelling our Animations perfectly, we are almost twice as effective because we are doing 2 things more in comparison to a Summoner who has no idea what Animation Delay Cancelling is. And if we are playing against a Summoner who is Animation Delay Cancelling, but not perfectly, then we can win if we can get a split second advantage to avoid hits and get free hits in! 

Of course, there is Spell Animation Cancelling as well. Champions, such as Riven, can truly shine by taking full advantage of this to be casting 2 or even 3 Spells simultaneously! Experiment around and figure out the limits of your Champion when casting.

What's the best way to improve mechanics? Well, since mechanics varies from Champion to Champion, this means we should be maining a role!

Mastering a lane is as equally difficult of a task. It's not something that can be taken half-hearted. It's something obtained through the experiences of many, many games of trial and error. For example, we need to know the approximate time the enemy jungler will gank, when to shove our lane or when to freeze, when to play passive or active based on our positioning, etc... This will all come through experience if we main a lane!

Yet, we try to buy every Champion in the game and "master" all lanes. Think about it. If we play only perhaps a 1/5 of how much the pros play, can we say that we have 300+ games on a single Champion or 1000+ games in a single lane?

Additionally, if we get our main role, we'll probably win because there is a high statistical chance that we will play against something that is just "filling" or someone that hasn't mastered the lane. We'll also know how to more gold-efficient with our gold if we know the perfect item build. More on this later. 

## Be Aggressive At Champion-Selection

The meta tells us to be passive at Champion Selection, and that we should fill if needed. But if I was successful in giving you a glimpse into a glitch in the meta that we can exploit, we know we can go up and beyond. 

The best thing we can do to get our role is to just be aggressive about calling our roles. Try "trolling" a bit in Champion Selection, for example:

* Type in all Korean letters. Then type the lane that you want at the end of the sentence. That way, they think you're Korean and will carry the game. 

* Show LoLking stats and say you're a smurf. 

* Type, [Role Name], brb restroom. This way, they'll think you're in the restroom; thus, you cannot respond to other people trying to steal your role. 

Of course, we can get creative here. Just have a line ready to copy and paste the moment you load into Champion Selections!

Sadly, we don't always get what we want in life; thus, we need a backup Champion and lane. Honestly however, if our win-rate in our main lane is 70%, then our win-rate for other lanes are probably 50% or lower. If I did the Math, it would actually be even better to dodge (though I don't advocate dodging!). 

"Counter-Picking"

The meta says to pick accordingly to your team and enemy. But how many times have you heard, "Oh, I'll pick X because he counters Y so hard." Then the game ends with that person feeding all game. This happens because counter-picking requires that we can actually play the Champion we are counter-picking with. This is highly unlikely since we aren't LCS Pros that have mastered a wide Champion pool.

Imagine the situation with the opponent trying to counter-pick us. Our opponents name is Bob. Most likely, Bob hasn't mastered his Champion. Bob plays with the philosophy of counter-picking; therefore, because Bob has too large of a Champion Pool, he has spread himself too thin (of skill and mechanics that would've been present if Bob had mained a role). 

On the otherhand, because we have mastered our role (which means even know how to counter our counters), we can beat Bob because he doesn't even know how to play his Champions!

Additionally, Bob probably hasn't experimented with a lot of item builds to see what is most gold-efficient to spend. So even if Bob has an Early Game edge, we know we can beat Bob Mid-Late Game because we have a better build. 

## Most Likely, the Recommended Item Build is Poor

The meta recommends certain items. I speak of two of these. The one that is recommended by the game developers, and the one that the community tells you to build. However, the ones recommended by the developers were created off the top of their heads. Obviously, they probably haven't experimented with hundreds of game testing different builds. Also, the ones recommended by community are rip-off builds of famous LCS players. But remember, solo queue works on rules very different from that of the LCS!

The best thing to do is to just think for yourself. Obviously, I can't give you a "best build" because every Champion is different. The best builds varies from Champion to Champion. I have, however, written articles for "general" optimum stat ratios. Check them out as a guideline for when experimenting with builds.

* [Optimum Health: Armor Stat ratio](http://news.gamerunners.gg/lol/calculating-optimum-stat-ratios/)

* [Optimum AA Bruiser Stat Ratio](http://news.gamerunners.gg/lol/calculating-optimum-stat-ratios-2/)

* [Optimum Spell-Caster Bruiser Stat Ratio](http://news.gamerunners.gg/lol/health-x-armor-3/)

* [Optimum AP Bruiser Stat Ratio](http://news.gamerunners.gg/lol/calculating-stat-ratios-3/)

* [Optimum ADC Stat Ratio](http://news.gamerunners.gg/lol/calculating-stat-ratios-adc-4/)

Remember, these ratios serve as merely a guideline. It's okay to break the ratio rules. And don't worry if you come up with a weird build. Rules are made to be broken! The citizens of The Matrix knows this best:

> Trinity: Neo... nobody has ever done this before.

> Neo: That's why it's going to work.

## It's Time to Choose!

![Elo Hell](/images/content/elo-hell-2.jpg)

Will you live in the realities of others, or will you reach your potential, to be a paragon of intelligence, and to expand your reality upon others? The meta, is indeed, a living and breathing creature. It adapts and changes its conglomeration of superficial rules. Cozy for the weak, but limiting for the strong, its existence is then justified upon Summoners the ritual of griefing, a form of bullying (which is an extreme form of socialization) other Summoners that dare question its teachings. However, no matter how strong it is, anything and everything always has a weakness, a hole in its matrix of being. It's ultimate fear is us, for we, the Summoners, have a secret weapon - curiosity. 

There are many more things I would like to discuss with you, Summoner. But my job is to merely open door. You, chosen one, must walk the walk. So which pill will it be?
