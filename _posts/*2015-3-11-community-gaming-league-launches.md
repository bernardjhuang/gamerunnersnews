[Community Gaming League (CGL)](http://www.communitygamingleague.com/) started as a LAN League of Legends event series in NYC by Chris Kovalik. From the LAN events, CGL grew into a close local NYC community of gamers who have spent hours together barhopping, watching streams, and gaming at Community Gaming's events. CGL's mission is to create a national gaming network and provide support for local gaming communities across North America. 

## Community Gaming League Spring Regional
