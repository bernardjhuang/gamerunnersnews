Taking away his cigar has been a mere hindrance to Grave’s rise in power; Graves has once again risen to popularity, taking the throne of one of the top ADCs in the Meta. In this article I will explore why Graves has his sudden resurgence in power, and how he is used to his full potential by the professional player **P1noy** from **Gambit Gaming**. Along the way, I aim to improve your understanding of Graves and how to effectively use him in your own games.

## Introduction

Graves has been for a long time a decently viable pick in niche situations, but nothing more than that, only sporting 35 competitive picks in the entirety of 2014 in all regions, and winning a meager **43%**. Though sporting unimpressive stats throughout the duration of the 4th season, he is in the perfect position to dominate the early rounds of Season 5.

The reason for his lack of success is quite simply the fact that he has always been outclassed by other ADCS. He was never truly terrible and considered a “troll pick”, but he was always mediocre; this point was reemphasized when Lucian was released. He was quickly recognized as the better version Graves, as he did everything that Graves was good at but better. He had superior range, damage (both burst and sustained) and scaling in all phases of the game. However, Lucian has recently been repeatedly nerfed in an Irelia-like fashion, slowly whittling down his power. The other ADC which packs a powerful burst, Corki, will soon be toned down in the upcoming patches, as planned in the PBE.

Contributing to his rise are certain stealth buffs caused by the shifting meta due to dramatic SR rework. Early game is now much more important than in season 4, as buffs which the dragon grants has much more of an impact in the game, and is extremely valued as of the current patches. Grave’s ability to dominate the early game allows his team to take dragons at early levels, and beat back the enemy if they attempt to contest this objective. Graves has many advantages such as:

* Amazing burst, one of the strongest of all ADCs. He has the potential to 100-0 enemy ADCs and squishy supports. This allows him to splitpush as he can easily duel out most enemy ADCs and certain mid laners.

* He has great chase potential with his dash, in case an enemy survives his burst combo. His dash also allows him to escape when splitpushing. Furthermore, it has an extraordinarily low cooldown when Graves is in combat, allowing him to have excellent kiting potential in the late game.

* He is probably the tankyest ADC with his passive, and aids in his dueling potential in all stages, as well as his ability to survive assassins burst damage in teamfights. His passive gives him 30 armor and MR when fully stacked. This stat is flat and does not scale which gives him super tankyness in the early game, but reduces to a subpar statistic in the lategame. 

* When ahead, he snowballs out of control. After a few kills he is able to completely dominate and dictate his lane. Not only can he zone out his opponents, he can melt them down with his combo the instant the return to lane. 

* He has decent wave clear and he can clear out most waves in the midgame with his Q-W combo.

* He also, fares decently against other strong ADCs at the moment.

However, it is his weaknesses that are often talked about when discussing this champion.

* He is short ranged ADC with only 525 range. Furthermore, his Q ability, Buckshot, forces Graves to remain at close range in order to do maximum damage. This means that the player needs to have good positioning and know when to get in close with the enemy.

* When Graves is ahead, he will dominate, when he is behind will become almost useless as he will be instantly deleted before he can stack up his passive and with his dangerous playstyle and lack of good utility, he essentially becomes a nonfactor.

## Who is P1noy?

Kristoffer **"P1noy"** Albao Lund Pedersen is the current ADC for EU team **Gambit Gaming**. Previously known as **“Krislund”**, he played his debut against **SK Gaming Prime**, keeping Gambit in the EU LCS by winning 3 to 1. After this game, he was announced to fully replace **Genja**, this is when he changed his name. In this article I will analyze the final game of IEM Cologne Finals against Counter Logic Gaming.

In that series, **P1noy** picked Graves twice, winning both games with impressive scores of **9/3/4** and **10/1/4**. It was certainly an impressive feat as he was facing **“Doublelift”**, who is considered one of the best ADCs in the west. 

## In Game Analysis

### Pick & Bans

Graves was picked last in Gambit’s rotation, while his support, Thresh, was picked first. Graves synergizes with supports that can make lock down enemies or add to his burst. Thresh does both of these things effectively, and is considered a good pick to go with Graves. In game 4, Sona is picked with Graves and Sona is known as one of the highest burst damage ADCs. Combined with Grave’s damage, they can easily set up a kill lane at bot. Graves was also picked to counter Lucian, who was CLG’s second pick. Graves counters Lucian as he has more upfront burst and his Smokescreen and mobility allows him to easily weave out of Lucians spells, especially The Culling. 

### Early Game

![Early Game IEM Cologne Finals vs CLG](/images/content/graves-guide-clg-iem.png)

Early game was certainly not optimal for Gambit Gaming. **Edward** walks up into the enemy Tri-bush to get some deep wards but is forced to run around and back down after being chased by Lucian and Janna.  This means Graves is zoned out but Janna and Lucian when he arrives in lane. However, due to the damage potential of the duo, the engage as soon as Thresh returns into lane. They manage to drop **Aphromoo** down to about 220 health and take inflict 200 damage on **Doublelift**, while losing less than 100 between them. However due to being zoned out the enemy bot lane hits level 2 first, and immediately acts upon their advantage by going in, this causes them to be zoned out for most of the lane and **Doublelift has more than double Grave’s CS**. 

![Graves optimal lane freeze](/images/content/graves-guide-lane-freeze.png)

However, they get an optimal lane freeze near their tower and **P1noy** manages to even up the CS disparity at the 4:30 minute mark. After losing yet another trade at 6:30 P1noy goes back and buys **Pickaxe** and **Boots of Speed**. This puts him at disadvantages as Lucian returns to lane with a **BF Sword**. However, due to Graves being a superior damage source in early levels they manage to go even in a trade at 8:20, although the supports grabs the kills. It is important to note that Lucian uses flash while Graves does not. Lucian manages to afford boots while Graves gets two more **Long Swords**. When he hits level 6 he outclasses Lucian in a duel and immediately engages when Janna is warding Tri-bush. He melts down Lucian and chases with flash to secure the kill. After both ADC’s dying in ganks the lane becomes a passive farm lane. 

### What to learn:


* Trade when your cooldowns are up and when you have mana.

* When losing lane in the early game, stall out by freezing lane until an advantage arises. 

* Go in immediately when you hit level 6, as you have a large damage spike.

## Mid Game

The lane becomes a passive farm lane until 17 minutes. **P1noy** engages and outduels Lucian; he backs off by dashing out of his ultimate when Janna appears.  After dropping Lucian to low health, **Gambit** secure dragon without any contesting. He duels Lucian whenever his ultimate is up and eventually completes **Infinity Edge & Brutalizer** before Lucian’s IE is completed. He is able to instantly delete Lucian with his combo, even when under the tower.

> Note the combo that P1noy utilizes, he uses his ultimate first then flashes in optimal buckshot range and both unleash on Lucian at the same time. This means that even **Doublelift** cannot react in time to dodge this combo.

This ultimately (pun not intended) allows Graves to snowball and dominate the game.

## What to learn:

* Engage with ultimate at every opportunity.

* Force out the enemy bot lane to easily take uncontested dragons.

* Shop often to build up an item advantage in order to ensure that you won’t lose fights.

## Statistics

### Ability Order 

![P1noy's Grave's Ability Order](/images/content/graves-guide-p1noy-ability-order.png)
 
As shown, **P1noy**, maxes Q as it is Graves’s primary damage source in term of his abilities, and it scales decently in terms of levels at a scaling of 60 / 95 / 130 / 165 / 200 (+ 80% bonus AD).  Note that in the ideal situation where all 3 Qs connect with an enemy it has the potential to deal 108 / 171 / 234 / 297 / 360(+ 144% bonus AD). This is a phenomenal boost in terms of his burst damage. **Pinoy** maxes E second. In some situations, maxing W is also viable but I think that maxing E is better in almost all situations, as it allows you to have better kiting and positioning in teamfights and grants you an immense 70% AS boost. Graves is able to chunk down towers with his attack speed, and with decent ward coverage, save E to get away from ganks and collapses.  As with almost all champions, take a point in R whenever possible. 

### Runes

![P1noy's Graves Runes](/images/content/graves-guide-p1noy-runes.png)
 
These are the runes that **P1noy** uses on Graves; they are fairly standard marksmen runes. The armor helps him sustain lane in lane as he does not build lifesteal early on. It is important to note that he takes more attack speed runes than usual since he builds **Infinity Edge, Yomumus, BT and then a pickaxe which will most likely be built into a last whisper**. The attack speed combined with the steroid from his E allows him to go without an attack speed item.

### Masteries

![P1noys Graves Masteries](/images/content/graves-guide-p1noy-masteries.png)
 
Once again, his masteries are very standard and there is nothing unusual about them. He does not take Blade Weaving but he takes Frenzy. This is due to the high critical chance build that he runs. He also runs the safer route with 1 point in Warlord instead of Dangerous Game which is preferred by some. 

### Items

He takes mainly AD items such as **Infinity Edge, Yomumus and Bloodthirster**. This is because Graves is a caster type of ADC relies on spells as a large porting on his damage, especially his burst damage. Furthermore, he already as an immense steroid which means that he can build less AS. In SoloQ he occasionally builds a Stattik Shiv, which is the most bursty of the attack speed items. Defensive items are not as prioritized on Graves compared to other ADCs as he has innate tankyness from his passive. **Banshee’s Veil, Guardian Angel and Mercurial Scimitar** are the defensive items that are used in almost all games. 

## Conclusion

**P1noy** is one of the first to utilize Graves in the new season. I recommend that you learn him as I think he will be the next top tier ADC and his aggressive playstyle is both fun and helpful towards your development of ADC mechanics. I hope you learned something from this article and good luck on Summoner’s Rift!
