A long time ago (okay, not so long ago actually) when Dota 1 was still a WarCraft III custom map there weren't many Dota related channels one could watch. The champion in terms of casual entertainment was WoDotA with its distinctive “We Are Electric” soundtrack. Hyped to the maximum, I eagerly waited for its new episodes and the stunning wombo combos, low HP escapes and jukes.

Skip to present day and we have Dota 2. Aside from all of its other perks, Dota 2 has one more advantage: a wide range of terrific Dota content YouTube channels. It's not surprising given the broad coverage esports are now given...and given the fact that Dota 2 is a leading contemporary esport.

I'll be frank: I'm usually not into YouTube subscriptions and even when I enjoy something, I rarely subscribe to the creator's channel. I don't know why it happens so – some weird reluctance perhaps? However, I've surprisingly found myself subscribing to a number of Dota 2 channels due to their high quality, engaging, and above all – informational/educational content. 

Here's a my top 5 list of insight-filled YouTube channels that I thoroughly enjoy on a weekly (or even daily!) basis. Of course, there are a lot more cool channels out there, but these are my to-go ones.

### #1 [hOlyhexOr](https://www.youtube.com/user/hOlyhexOr)

hOlyhexOr is an old dog in terms of Dota. I remember his sick hooks and arrows (he specializes in playing Pudge and Mirana) back in the day around 2007/8. An ex-professional player, he now mostly sticks to video creation and pubstomping other players' faces.

He has gradually expanded his YouTube content portfolio and has established himself as a one-stop location for everything Dota 2 related. I mostly enjoy his Dota 2 Big Plays Weekly and The Art of Juking / The Art of Hexor playlists. However, there are tons of live gameplays, coverage of professional matches, video montages, highlights and pro gaming gameplay movies about famous Dota 2 players.

I particularly like the music in his channel as he uses songs from Monstercat who are a favourite label of mine. Cool electronic music, pro plays and action. What more could you wish for?

I especially want to mention his [“Luck Is No Excuse”](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL37CzvwiWXoi7tYNzf0g_yzCz4AgEU_h-) series – all of parts of it are a total masterpiece and I've rewatched each one a dozen times.

### #2 [Merlini Dota](https://www.youtube.com/user/MerliniDota)

Another veteran, Merlini is one of the most friendly and insightful people in the Dota scene. Legendary for his Zeus plays and patch analysis, it's only natural he has a steady follower base after all these years.

His channel is fairly small in terms of videos compared to many other Dota 2 related channels. However, the quality of his videos is outstanding and every second counts without any exceptions. Maybe the best word to describe the content he produces would be “educational”. Merlini educates without any condescending tone. On top of that, compared to many other casters and content creators he has a terrific vocabulary and his insights are well-versed.

While it's a real pleasure to watch Merlini play (or cast, as he has done on several occasions across tournaments), what I particularly value are his patch analysis videos ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcmWfVFmaBr0x38ferzseQAXbN8_SHfS7 ).

### #3 [JoinDota](https://www.youtube.com/user/joinDOTA)

There's no Dota 2 channel list without JoinDota. However, I'm not including them here only due to the volume of their videos (in the thousands) or their popularity. Whenever there is a tournament match I have been particularly interested but missed out due to work or another commitment, I head out to JoinDota's YouTube channel.

Lots of VODs, lots of condensed highlights videos and outstanding production. All paired with a hats off approach in terms of consistency, this is a solid reason to be a YouTube subscriber of theirs.

From “The International” to Dreamhack or ESL One and the various cups and tournaments, these guys broadcast everything and will keep you in the known for current happenings in the pro scene.

I really enjoyed their “X Marks The News” playlist. To my disappointment, though, it seems to have laid off the shelves.

### #4 [DotaCinema](https://www.youtube.com/user/DotaCinema)

Admit it: you expected me to put DotaCinema in the very beginning of this article. Maybe it was the first name it came to you when you read a title that has to do with Dota 2 related YouTube channels.

DotaCinema deserve their popularity and subscriber base of over 1 million subscribers. Their portfolio of videos is enormous and encompasses each and every aspect of Dota 2 – from mechanics, to cosmetic items creation to top plays, fail plays or entertainment channels. 

When Dota 2 came out, it was DotaCinema who started a hero spotlight channel to introduce and discuss every single hero to starting out players. It was also them who transitioned the WoDota format of top plays weekly into Dota 2. I really admire what they have done and continue doing for the Dota 2 community.

What I really enjoy are their “Symphony of skills” and “Symphony of fails” series, as well as Wronchi Animation's ["The Dota 2 Reporter"](https://www.youtube.com/user/WronchiAnimation) who now runs in a separate video channel. Their ["A-Z Dual Lane Challenge"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF50cvv4MhVraOIMkhBYVUpiBGVniqwKQ) is also particularly entertaining and insightful at the same time.

### #5 [NoobFromUA](https://www.youtube.com/user/noobfromua/)

NoobFromUA is yet another Dota YouTuber with quite a long stay in the niche. He uploads pretty versatile stuff, but his specialty is speed.

By speed I mean the fact that he uploads pro plays or current tournament highlights in mere minutes. I guarantee that he'll be the first to capture a cool moment and have you enjoying it with outstanding video editing and his trademark awesome taste in music. NoobFromUA's style is quirky, memetic at times, and his coverage shifts from pub moments to pro plays fragments.
My particular note of interest is his [“Megacreeps Dota 2” playlist]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD-ZsSKclZfjrRzRmAVqgP__Tj2Rq8kR4) which features stunning situations and holy-hell-how-the-fuck-did-they-do-this comeback moments.

All has not been revealed...

So these are my top 5 to-go channels when you're seeking diverse, insightful content that has to do with Dota 2. Whether it is for watching pro plays (and having them analyzed), getting a new patch explained or witnessing game mechanics, all these channels are the perfect place to do so.

Next time I'll focus on the top YouTube Dota 2 channels that are related to comedy relief and various funny stuff. Don't forget to tune in!
